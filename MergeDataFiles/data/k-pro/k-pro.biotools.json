                "abstract": "The study of protein folding plays a crucial role in improving our understanding of protein function and of the relationship between genetics and phenotypes. In particular, understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of the folding process is important for uncovering the mechanisms behind human disorders caused by protein misfolding. To address this issue, it is essential to collect and curate experimental kinetic and thermodynamic data on protein folding. K-Pro is a new database designed for collecting and storing experimental kinetic data on monomeric proteins, with a two-state folding mechanism. With 1,529 records from 62 proteins corresponding to 65 structures, K-Pro contains various kinetic parameters such as the logarithm of the folding and unfolding rates, Tanford's β and the ϕ values. When available, the database also includes thermodynamic parameters associated with the kinetic data. K-Pro features a user-friendly interface that allows browsing and downloading kinetic data of interest. The graphical interface provides a visual representation of the protein and mutants, and it is cross-linked to key databases such as PDB, UniProt, and PubMed. K-Pro is open and freely accessible through https://folding.biofold.org/k-pro and supports the latest versions of popular browsers.",
