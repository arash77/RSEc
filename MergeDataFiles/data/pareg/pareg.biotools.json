    "description": "Coherent pathway enrichment estimation by modeling inter-pathway dependencies using regularized regression.\nCompute pathway enrichment scores while accounting for term-term relations. This package uses a regularized multiple linear regression to regress differential expression p-values obtained from multi-condition experiments on a pathway membership matrix. By doing so, it is able to incorporate additional biological knowledge into the enrichment analysis and to estimate pathway enrichment scores more robustly.",

                "abstract": "Gene set enrichment methods are a common tool to improve the interpretability of gene lists as obtained, for example, from differential gene expression analyses. They are based on computing whether dysregulated genes are located in certain biological pathways more often than expected by chance. Gene set enrichment tools rely on pre-existing pathway databases such as KEGG, Reactome, or the Gene Ontology. These databases are increasing in size and in the number of redundancies between pathways, which complicates the statistical enrichment computation. Results: We address this problem and develop a novel gene set enrichment method, called pareg, which is based on a regularized generalized linear model and directly incorporates dependencies between gene sets related to certain biological functions, for example, due to shared genes, in the enrichment computation. We show that pareg is more robust to noise than competing methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover known pathways as well as to suggest novel treatment targets in an exploratory analysis using breast cancer samples from TCGA.",
