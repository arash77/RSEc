                "abstract": "Numerous studies have been published which, separately, investigate the influence of molecular features on oncological and cardiac pathologies. Nevertheless, the relationship between both families of diseases at the molecular level is an emerging area within onco-cardiology/cardio-oncology. This paper presents a new open-source database that aims to organize the curated information concerning the molecular features validated in patients involved in both cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Entities like gene, variation, drug, study and others are modelled as objects of a database which is populated with curated information from 83 papers identified by systematic literature searched for up to 2021. Researchers will discover new connections among them to validate hypotheses or suggest new ones. Special care has been taken to use standard nomenclature for genes, pathologies and all the objects for which accepted conventions exist. The database can be consulted via the web with a system of simplified queries, but it also accepts any query. It will be updated and refined with the incorporation of new studies as they become available. Database URL http://biodb.uv.es/oncocardio/",
