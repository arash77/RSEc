                "abstract": "Mycotoxins are likely to be converted into masked forms when subjected to plant metabolism or food processing. These masked forms of mycotoxins together with their prototypes may cause mixture toxicity effects, causing adverse effects on animal welfare and productivity. The structure elucidation of masked mycotoxins is the most challenging task in mycotoxin research due to the limitations of traditional analysis methods. To assist in the rapid identification of masked mycotoxins, we developed a data-driven online prediction tool, MycotoxinDB, based on reaction rules. Using MycotoxinDB, we identified seven masked DONs from wheat samples. Given its widespread applications, we expect that MycotoxinDB will become an indispensable tool in future mycotoxin research.
