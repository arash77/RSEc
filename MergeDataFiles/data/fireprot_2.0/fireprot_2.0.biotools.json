    "description": "FireProt 2.0 is an extension of the original FireProt web for the fully automated design of stable multiple-point mutants. FireProt constructs stable mutants using both structural and evolutionary information. FireProt 2.0 also integrates the AlphaFold database and the homology modelling for structure prediction, enabling calculations starting from a sequence. Multiple-point designs are constructed using the Bronâ€“Kerbosch algorithm minimizing the antagonistic effect between the individual mutations. Users can newly limit the FireProt calculation to a set of user-defined mutations, run saturation mutagenesis of the whole protein or select rigidifying mutations based on B-factors. Evolution-based back-to-consensus strategy is complemented by ancestral sequence reconstruction.",
