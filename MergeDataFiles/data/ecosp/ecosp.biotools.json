                "abstract": "Background: Surface polysaccharides (SPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (O antigen) and capsular polysaccharide (K antigen), play a key role in the pathogenicity of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Gene cluster for polysaccharide antigen biosynthesis encodes various glycosyltransferases (GTs), which drive the process of SP synthesis and determine the serotype. Results: In this study, a total of 7,741 E. coli genomic sequences were chosen for systemic data mining. The monosaccharides in both O and K antigens were dominated by D-hexopyranose, and the SPs in 70–80% of the strains consisted of only the five most common hexoses (or some of them). The linkages between the two monosaccharides were mostly α-1,3 (23.15%) and β-1,3 (20.49%) bonds. Uridine diphosphate activated more than 50% of monosaccharides for glycosyltransferase reactions. These results suggest that the most common pathways could be integrated into chassis cells to promote glycan biosynthesis. We constructed a database (EcoSP, http://ecosp.dmicrobe.cn/) for browse this information, such as monosaccharide synthesis pathways. It can also be used for serotype analysis and GT annotation of known or novel E. coli sequences, thus facilitating the diagnosis and typing. Conclusions: Summarizing and analyzing the properties of these polysaccharide antigens and GTs are of great significance for designing glycan-based vaccines and the synthetic glycobiology.",
