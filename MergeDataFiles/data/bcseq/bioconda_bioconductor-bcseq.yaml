about:
  description: This Rcpp-based package implements a highly efficient data structure
    and algorithm for performing alignment of short reads from CRISPR or shRNA screens
    to reference barcode library. Sequencing error are considered and matching qualities
    are evaluated based on Phred scores. A Bayes' classifier is employed to predict
    the originating barcode of a read. The package supports provision of user-defined
    probability models for evaluating matching qualities. The package also supports
    multi-threading.
