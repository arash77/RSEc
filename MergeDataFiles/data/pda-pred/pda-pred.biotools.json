                "abstract": "Protein–DNA interactions play an important role in various biological processes such as gene expression, replication, and transcription. Understanding the important features that dictate the binding affinity of protein-DNA complexes and predicting their affinities is important for elucidating their recognition mechanisms. In this work, we have collected the experimental binding free energy (ΔG) for a set of 391 Protein-DNA complexes and derived several structure-based features such as interaction energy, contact potentials, volume and surface area of binding site residues, base step parameters of the DNA and contacts between different types of atoms. Our analysis on relationship between binding affinity and structural features revealed that the important factors mainly depend on the number of DNA strands as well as functional and structural classes of proteins. Specifically, binding site properties such as number of atom contacts between the DNA and protein, volume of protein binding sites and interaction-based features such as interaction energies and contact potentials are important to understand the binding affinity. Further, we developed multiple regression equations for predicting the binding affinity of protein-DNA complexes belonging to different structural and functional classes. Our method showed an average correlation and mean absolute error of 0.78 and 0.98 kcal/mol, respectively, between the experimental and predicted binding affinities on a jack-knife test. We have developed a webserver, PDA-PreD (Protein-DNA Binding affinity predictor), for predicting the affinity of protein-DNA complexes and it is freely available at https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/pdapred/",
