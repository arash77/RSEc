                "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides insights into gene expression heterogeneities in diverse cell types underlying homeostasis, development and pathological states. However, the loss of spatial information hinders its applications in deciphering spatially related features, such as cell-cell interactions in a spatial context. Here, we present STellaris (https://spatial.rhesusbase.com), a web server aimed to rapidly assign spatial information to scRNA-seq data based on their transcriptomic similarity with public spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. STellaris is founded on 101 manually curated ST datasets comprising 823 sections across different organs, developmental stages and pathological states from humans and mice. STellaris accepts raw count matrix and cell type annotation of scRNA-seq data as the input, and maps single cells to spatial locations in the tissue architecture of properly matched ST section. Spatially resolved information for intercellular communications, such as spatial distance and ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs), are further characterized between annotated cell types. Moreover, we also expanded the application of STellaris in spatial annotation of multiple regulatory levels with single-cell multiomics data, using the transcriptome as a bridge. STellaris was applied to several case studies to showcase its utility of adding value to the ever-growing scRNA-seq data from a spatial perspective.",
