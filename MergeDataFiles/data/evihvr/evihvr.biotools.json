                "abstract": "Motivation: Virus receptors are presented on the cell surfaces of a host and are key for viral infection of host cells. However, no unified resource for the study of viral receptors is currently available. Results: To address this problem, we built EVIHVR, a platform for analyzing the expression and variation, and for the identification of human virus receptors. EVIHVR provides three functions: (1) Receptor expression function for browsing and analyzing the expression of human virus receptors in various human tissues/cells; (2) Receptor gene polymorphism function for analyzing the genetic polymorphism of human virus receptors in different human populations and human tissues; and (3) Predict receptor function for identifying potential virus receptors based on differential expression analysis. EVIHVR can become a useful tool for the analysis and identification of human virus receptors. Availability and implementation: EVIHVR is publicly available at http://www.computationalbiology.cn/EVIHVR/#/.",
