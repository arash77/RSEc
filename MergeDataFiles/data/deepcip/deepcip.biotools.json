                "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been found to have the ability to encode proteins through internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), which are essential RNA regulatory elements for cap-independent translation. Identification of IRES elements in circRNA is crucial for understanding its function. Previous studies have presented IRES predictors based on machine learning techniques, but they were mainly designed for linear RNA IRES. In this study, we proposed DeepCIP (Deep learning method for CircRNA IRES Prediction), a multimodal deep learning approach that employs both sequence and structural information for circRNA IRES prediction. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sequence and structure models used by DeepCIP in feature extraction and suggest that integrating sequence and structural information efficiently improves the accuracy of prediction. The comparison studies indicate that DeepCIP outperforms other comparative methods on the test set and real circRNA IRES dataset. Furthermore, through the integration of an interpretable analysis mechanism, we elucidate the sequence patterns learned by our model, which align with the previous discovery of motifs that facilitate circRNA translation. Thus, DeepCIP has the potential to enhance the study of the coding potential of circRNAs and contribute to the design of circRNA-based drugs.
