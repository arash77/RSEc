    "description": "MALVIRUS is a fast and accurate tool for genotyping haploid individuals that does not require to assemble the read nor mapping them to a reference genome. It is tailored to work with virological data and can genotype an individual directly from sequencing data in minutes.\n\nMALVIRUS is divided into two logically distinct steps: the creation of a variant catalog from a set of assemblies and the genotype calling. The first step is based on mafft and snp-sites, whereas the second step is based on KMC and MALVA.\n\nThe variant catalog can be built once and reused for genotyping multiple individuals.\n\nPlease see the website for additional details.\n\nMALVIRUS is distributed as a Docker image and is publicly available on GitHub and Docker Hub under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 or later. MALVIRUS was mainly developed and tested under Ubuntu GNU/Linux version 18.04 but works wherever Docker is available.",

                "abstract": "Background: Being able to efficiently call variants from the increasing amount of sequencing data daily produced from multiple viral strains is of the utmost importance, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to track the spread of the viral strains across the globe. Results: We present MALVIRUS, an easy-to-install and easy-to-use application that assists users in multiple tasks required for the analysis of a viral population, such as the SARS-CoV-2. MALVIRUS allows to: (1) construct a variant catalog consisting in a set of variations (SNPs/indels) from the population sequences, (2) efficiently genotype and annotate variants of the catalog supported by a read sample, and (3) when the considered viral species is the SARS-CoV-2, assign the input sample to the most likely Pango lineages using the genotyped variations. Conclusions: Tests on Illumina and Nanopore samples proved the efficiency and the effectiveness of MALVIRUS in analyzing SARS-CoV-2 strain samples with respect to publicly available data provided by NCBI and the more complete dataset provided by GISAID. A comparison with state-of-the-art tools showed that MALVIRUS is always more precise and often have a better recall.",
