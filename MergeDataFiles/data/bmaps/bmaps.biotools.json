                "abstract": "Fragment-based drug design uses data about where, and how strongly, small chemical fragments bind to proteins, to assemble new drug molecules. Over the past decade, we have been successfully using fragment data, derived from thermodynamically rigorous Monte Carlo fragment-protein binding simulations, in dozens of preclinical drug programs. However, this approach has not been available to the broader research community because of the cost and complexity of doing simulations and using design tools. We have developed a web application, called BMaps, to make fragment-based drug design widely available with greatly simplified user interfaces. BMaps provides access to a large repository (>550) of proteins with 100s of precomputed fragment maps, druggable hot spots, and high-quality water maps. Users can also employ their own structures or those from the Protein Data Bank and AlphaFold DB. Multigigabyte data sets are searched to find fragments in bondable orientations, ranked by a binding-free energy metric. The designers use this to select modifications that improve affinity and other properties. BMaps is unique in combining conventional tools such as docking and energy minimization with fragment-based design, in a very easy to use and automated web application. The service is available at https://www.boltzmannmaps.com.",
