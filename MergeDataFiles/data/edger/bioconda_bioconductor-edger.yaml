about:
  description: Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles with
    biological replication. Implements a range of statistical methodology based on
    the negative binomial distributions, including empirical Bayes estimation, exact
    tests, generalized linear models and quasi-likelihood tests. As well as RNA-seq,
    it be applied to differential signal analysis of other types of genomic data that
    produce read counts, including ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, Bisulfite-seq, SAGE and CAGE.
