                "abstract": "Background: Cancer immunotherapy is implemented by identifying antigens that are presented on the cell surface of cancer cells and illicit T-cell response (Schumacher and Schreiber, Science 348:69–74, 2015; Waldman et al., Nat Rev Immunol 20:651–668, 2020; Zhang et al., Front Immunol 12:672,356, 2021b). Classical candidates of such antigens are the peptides resulting from genetic alterations and are named “neoantigen\" (Schumacher and Schreiber, Science 348:69–74, 2015). Neoantigens have been widely catalogued across several human cancer types (Tan et al., Database (Oxford) 2020;2020b; Vigneron et al., Cancer Immun 13:15, 2013; Yi et al., iScience 24:103,107, 2021; Zhang et al., BMC Bioinformatics 22:40, 2021a). Recently, a new class of inducible antigens has been identified, namely Substitutants, that are produced as a result of aberrant protein translation (Pataskar et al., Nature 603:721–727, 2022). Main: Catalogues of Substitutant expression across human cancer types, their specificity and association to gene expression signatures remain elusive for the scientific community's access. As a solution, we present ABPEPserver, an online database and analytical platform that can visualize a large-scale tumour proteomics analysis of Substitutant expression across eight tumour types sourced from the CPTAC database (Edwards et al., J Proteome Res 14:2707–2713, 2015). Functionally, ABPEPserver offers the analysis of gene-association signatures of Substitutant peptides, a comparison of enrichment between tumour and tumour-adjacent normal tissues, and a list of peptides that serve as candidates for immunotherapy design. ABPEPserver will significantly enhance the exploration of aberrant protein production in human cancer, as exemplified in a case study. Conclusion: ABPEPserver is designed on an R SHINY platform to catalogue Substitutant peptides in human cancer. The application is available at https://rhpc.nki.nl/sites/shiny/ABPEP/ .
