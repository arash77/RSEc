    "description": "Python-C Parallel KVFinder (pyKVFinder) is an efficient and integrable Python package for biomolecular cavity detection and characterization in data science. Besides conventional cavity properties such as volume and area, which are stored as Python dictionaries, pyKVFinder computes cavity depth and hydropathy. Similar to cavity points, these spatial and physicochemical properties are stored as Python ndarrays and can be visualized using Python molecular visualization widgets. In general, pyKVFinder is designed for efficient scripting routines built on easy-to-handle data structures, such as Python dictionaries and NumPy N-dimensional arrays (ndarrays), and can be building blocks for data science and drug design applications.",

                "abstract": "Background: Biomolecular interactions that modulate biological processes occur mainly in cavities throughout the surface of biomolecular structures. In the data science era, structural biology has benefited from the increasing availability of biostructural data due to advances in structural determination and computational methods. In this scenario, data-intensive cavity analysis demands efficient scripting routines built on easily manipulated data structures. To fulfill this need, we developed pyKVFinder, a Python package to detect and characterize cavities in biomolecular structures for data science and automated pipelines. Results: pyKVFinder efficiently detects cavities in biomolecular structures and computes their volume, area, depth and hydropathy, storing these cavity properties in NumPy arrays. Benefited from Python ecosystem interoperability and data structures, pyKVFinder can be integrated with third-party scientific packages and libraries for mathematical calculations, machine learning and 3D visualization in automated workflows. As proof of pyKVFinder’s capabilities, we successfully identified and compared ADRP substrate-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and a set of homologous proteins with pyKVFinder, showing its integrability with data science packages such as matplotlib, NGL Viewer, SciPy and Jupyter notebook. Conclusions: We introduce an efficient, highly versatile and easily integrable software for detecting and characterizing biomolecular cavities in data science applications and automated protocols. pyKVFinder facilitates biostructural data analysis with scripting routines in the Python ecosystem and can be building blocks for data science and drug design applications.",

                "abstract": "Confining molecular guests within artificial hosts has provided a major driving force in the rational design of supramolecular cages with tailored properties. Over the last 30 years, a set of design strategies have been developed that enabled the controlled synthesis of a myriad of cages. Recently, there has been a growing interest in involving in silico methods in this toolbox. Cavity shape and size are important parameters that can be easily accessed by inexpensive geometric algorithms. Although these algorithms are well developed for the detection of nonartificial cavities (e.g., enzymes), they are not routinely used for the rational design of supramolecular cages. In order to test the capabilities of this tool, we have evaluated the performance and characteristics of seven different cavity characterization software in the context of 22 analogues of well-known supramolecular cages. Among the tested software, KVFinder project and Fpocket proved to be the most software to characterize supramolecular cavities. With the results of this work, we aim to popularize this underused technique within the supramolecular community.",
