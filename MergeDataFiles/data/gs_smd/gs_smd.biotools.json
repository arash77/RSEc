                "abstract": "Despite recent advances in research, the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood yet. Understanding the process of cleavage and then trimming of peptide substrates, can help selectively block γ-secretase (GS) to stop overproduction of the amyloidogenic products. Our GS-SMD server (https://gs-smd.biomodellab.eu/) allows cleaving and unfolding of all currently known GS substrates (more than 170 peptide substrates). The substrate structure is obtained by threading of the substrate sequence into the known structure of GS complex. The simulations are performed in an implicit water-membrane environment so they are performed rather quickly, 2-6 h per job, depending on the mode of calculations (part of GS complex or the whole structure). It is also possible to introduce mutations to the substrate and GS and pull any part of the substrate in any direction using the steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations with constant velocity. The obtained trajectories are visualized and analyzed in the interactive way. One can also compare multiple simulations using the interaction frequency analysis. GS-SMD server can be useful for revealing mechanisms of substrate unfolding and role of mutations in this process.",
