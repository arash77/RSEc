MutViz is a tool for the identification of mutation enrichments on arbitrary sets of user-defined regions; for a variety of cancer types, it contains preloaded mutations from public datasets, well organized within an effective database organization. MutViz provides a user-friendly interface helping the user in providing sets of regions as input and in obtaining their fast exploration as output, together with simple statistical testing of novel hypotheses.",

                "abstract": "Patterns of somatic single nucleotide variants observed in human cancers vary widely between different tumor types. They depend not only on the activity of diverse mutational processes, such as exposure to ultraviolet light and the deamination of methylated cytosines, but largely also on the sequence content of different genomic regions on which these processes act. With MutViz (http://gmql.eu/mutviz/), we have presented a user-friendly web tool for the identification of mutation enrichments that offers preloaded mutations from public datasets for a variety of cancer types, well organized within an effective database architecture. Somatic mutation patterns can be visually and statistically analyzed within arbitrary sets of small, user-provided genomic regions, such as promoters or collections of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we present MutViz 2.0, a largely extended and consolidated version of the tool: We took into account the immediate (trinucleotide) sequence context of mutations, improved the representation of clinical annotation of tumor samples and devised a method for signature refitting on limited genomic regions to infer the contribution of individual mutational processes to the mutation patterns observed in these regions. We described both the features of MutViz 2.0, concentrating on the novelties, and the substantial re-engineering of the cloud-based architecture.",
