                "abstract": "Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by certain filamentous fungi. They are common contaminants found in a wide variety of food matrices, thus representing a threat to public health, as they can be carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic, among other toxic effects. Several hundreds of mycotoxins have been reported, but only a few of them are regulated, due to the lack of data regarding their toxicity and mechanisms of action. Thus, a more comprehensive evaluation of the toxicity of mycotoxins found in foodstuffs is required. In silico toxicology approaches, such as Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, can be used to rapidly assess chemical hazards by predicting different toxicological endpoints. In this work, for the first time, a comprehensive database containing 4360 mycotoxins classified in 170 categories was constructed. Then, specific robust QSAR models for the prediction of mutagenicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity were generated, showing good accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. It must be highlighted that the developed QSAR models are compliant with the OECD regulatory criteria, and they can be used for regulatory purposes. Finally, all data were integrated into a web server that allows the exploration of the mycotoxin database and toxicity prediction. In conclusion, the developed tool is a valuable resource for scientists, industry, and regulatory agencies to screen the mutagenicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity of non-regulated mycotoxins.",
