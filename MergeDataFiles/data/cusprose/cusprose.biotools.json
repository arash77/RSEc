                "abstract": "We report here a new application, CustomProteinSearch (CusProSe), whose purpose is to help users to search for proteins of interest based on their domain composition. The application is customizable. It consists of two independent tools, IterHMMBuild and ProSeCDA. IterHMMBuild allows the iterative construction of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles for conserved domains of selected protein sequences, while ProSeCDA scans a proteome of interest against an HMM profile database, and annotates identified proteins using user-defined rules. CusProSe was successfully used to identify, in fungal genomes, genes encoding key enzyme families involved in secondary metabolism, such as polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), hybrid PKS-NRPS and dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases (DMATS), as well as to characterize distinct terpene synthases (TS) sub-families. The highly configurable characteristics of this application makes it a generic tool, which allows the user to refine the function of predicted proteins, to extend detection to new enzymes families, and may also be applied to biological systems other than fungi and to other proteins than those involved in secondary metabolism.",
