                "abstract": "Resource- and time-consuming biological experiments are unavoidable in traditional drug discovery, which have directly driven the evolution of various computational algorithms and tools for drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction. For improving the prediction reliability, a comprehensive platform is highly expected as some previously reported webservers are small in scale, single-method, or even out of service. In this study, we integrated the multiple-conformation based docking, 2D/3D ligand similarity search and deep learning approaches to construct a comprehensive webserver, namely D3CARP, for target prediction and virtual screening. Specifically, 9352 conformations with positive control of 1970 targets were used for molecular docking, and approximately 2 million target-ligand pairs were used for 2D/3D ligand similarity search and deep learning. Besides, the positive compounds were added as references, and related diseases of therapeutic targets were annotated for further disease-based DTI study. The accuracies of the molecular docking and deep learning approaches were 0.44 and 0.89, respectively. And the average accuracy of five ligand similarity searches was 0.94. The strengths of D3CARP encompass the support for multiple computational methods, ensemble docking, utilization of positive controls as references, cross-validation of predicted outcomes, diverse disease types, and broad applicability in drug discovery. The D3CARP is freely accessible at https://www.d3pharma.com/D3CARP/index.php.",
