    "description": "An unsupervised contrastive learning model that employs the expression of all measured genes and the spatial location of cells, to integrate multiple tissue sections. It enables the joint downstream analysis of multiple datasets not only in low-dimensional embeddings but also in the reconstructed full expression space.",
