All rights reserved.Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) enable systematic screening of DNA sequence variants for effects on transcriptional activity. However, convenient analysis tools are still needed. Results: We introduce MPRAscore, a novel tool to infer allele-specific effects on transcription from MPRA data. MPRAscore uses a weighted, variance-regularized method to calculate variant effect sizes robustly, and a permutation approach to test for significance without assuming normality or independence.",
