about:
  description: "mzTab-M is intended as a reporting standard for quantitative results\
    \ from\nmetabolomics/lipodomics approaches. This format is further intended to\n\
    provide local LIMS systems as well as MS metabolomics repositories a \nsimple\
    \ way to share and combine basic information. mzTab-M has been\ndeveloped with\
    \ a view to support the following general tasks. Facilitate \nthe sharing of final\
    \ experimental results, especially with researchers \noutside the field of metabolomics.\
    \ Export of results to external software,\nincluding programs such as Microsoft\
    \ Excel and Open Office Spreadsheet\nand statistical software / coding languages\
    \ such as R. Act as an output\nformat of (web-) services that report MS-based\
    \ results and thus can \nproduce standardized result pages. Be able to link to\
    \ the external \nexperimental evidence e.g. by referencing back to mzML files.\n"

  notes: 'jmzTab-M is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.

    This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default

    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can

    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS

    set globally this will take precedence.

    For example run it with "jmztab-m -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
