                "abstract": "Purpose: Brain shift that occurs during neurosurgery disturbs the brainâ€™s anatomy. Prediction of the brain shift is essential for accurate localisation of the surgical target. Biomechanical models have been envisaged as a possible tool for such predictions. In this study, we created a framework to automate the workflow for predicting intra-operative brain deformations. Methods: We created our framework by uniquely combining our meshless total Lagrangian explicit dynamics (MTLED) algorithm for computing soft tissue deformations, open-source software libraries and built-in functions within 3D Slicer, an open-source software package widely used for medical research. Our framework generates the biomechanical brain model from the pre-operative MRI, computes brain deformation using MTLED and outputs results in the form of predicted warped intra-operative MRI. Results: Our framework is used to solve three different neurosurgical brain shift scenarios: craniotomy, tumour resection and electrode placement. We evaluated our framework using nine patients. The average time to construct a patient-specific brain biomechanical model was 3 min, and that to compute deformations ranged from 13 to 23 min. We performed a qualitative evaluation by comparing our predicted intra-operative MRI with the actual intra-operative MRI. For quantitative evaluation, we computed Hausdorff distances between predicted and actual intra-operative ventricle surfaces. For patients with craniotomy and tumour resection, approximately 95% of the nodes on the ventricle surfaces are within two times the original in-plane resolution of the actual surface determined from the intra-operative MRI. Conclusion: Our framework provides a broader application of existing solution methods not only in research but also in clinics. We successfully demonstrated the application of our framework by predicting intra-operative deformations in nine patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures.",
