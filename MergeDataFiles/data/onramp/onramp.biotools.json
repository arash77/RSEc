                "abstract": "Recombinant plasmid vectors are versatile tools that have facilitated discoveries in molecular biology, genetics, proteomics, and many other fields. As the enzymatic and bacterial processes used to create recombinant DNA can introduce errors, sequence validation is an essential step in plasmid assembly. Sanger sequencing is the current standard for plasmid validation; however, this method is limited by an inability to sequence through complex secondary structure and lacks scalability when applied to full-plasmid sequencing of multiple plasmids owing to read-length limits. Although high-throughput sequencing does provide full-plasmid sequencing at scale, it is impractical and costly when used outside of library-scale validation. Here, we present Oxford nanopore-based rapid analysis of multiplexed plasmids (OnRamp), an alternative method for routine plasmid validation that combines the advantages of high-throughput sequencing's full-plasmid coverage and scalability with Sanger's affordability and accessibility by leveraging nanopore's long-read sequencing technology. We include customized wet-laboratory protocols for plasmid preparation along with a pipeline designed for analysis of read data obtained using these protocols. This analysis pipeline is deployed on the OnRamp web app, which generates alignments between actual and predicted plasmid sequences, quality scores, and read-level views. OnRamp is designed to be broadly accessible regardless of programming experience to facilitate more widespread adoption of long-read sequencing for routine plasmid validation. Here we describe the OnRamp protocols and pipeline and show our ability to obtain full sequences from pooled plasmids while detecting sequence variation even in regions of high secondary structure at less than half the cost of equivalent Sanger sequencing.",
