  description: 'SINA allows incorporating additional sequences into an existing

    multiple sequence alignment (MSA) without modifying the original

    alignment. While adding sequences to an MSA with SINA is usually

    faster than re-computing the entire MSA from an augmented set of

    unaligned sequences, the primary benefit lies in protecting

    investments made into the original MSA such as manual curation of the

    alignment, compute intensive phylogenetic tree reconstruction and

    taxonomic annotation of the resulting phylogeny.


    Additionally, SINA includes a homology search which uses the

    previously computed alignment to determine the most similar

    sequences. Based on the search results, a LCA based classification of

    the query sequence can be computed using taxonomic classifications

    assigned to the sequences comprising the reference MSA.


    SINA is used to compute the small and large subunit ribosomal RNA

    alignments provided by the SILVA_ project and is able to use the ARB_

    format reference databases released by the project.
