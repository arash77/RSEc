    "description": "Accelerated matrix-vector multiplications for matrices involving genotype covariates with applications in genomic prediction.\n\nmiraculix is a C/CUDA library for mathematical operations on compressed genotype data. It provides highly efficient routines that can be used in statistical analyses of genomic information, e.g. genome-wide association studies, genomic breeding value estimation and population summary statistics. As such, it offers interfaces to allow integration into existing C utilities as well as interoperability with higher-level programming languages such as R, Julia or Fortran.",

                "abstract": "In the last decade, a number of methods have been suggested to deal with large amounts of genetic data in genomic predictions. Yet, steadily growing population sizes and the suboptimal use of computational resources are pushing the practical application of these approaches to their limits. As an extension to the C/CUDA library miraculix, we have developed tailored solutions for the computation of genotype matrix multiplications which is a critical bottleneck in the empirical evaluation of many statistical models. We demonstrate the benefits of our solutions at the example of single-step models which make repeated use of this kind of multiplication. Targeting modern NvidiaÂ® GPUs as well as a broad range of CPU architectures, our implementation significantly reduces the time required for the estimation of breeding values in large population sizes. miraculix is released under the Apache 2.0 license and is freely available at https://github.com/alexfreudenberg/miraculix.",
