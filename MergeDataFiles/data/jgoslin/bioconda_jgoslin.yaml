  description: "The Grammar of succinct lipid nomenclature project (Goslin) defines\
    \ multiple grammers compatible with ANTLRv4 for different sources of shorthand\
    \ lipid nomenclature. \nThis allows to generate parsers based on the defined grammars,\
    \ which provide immediate feedback whether a processed lipid shorthand notation\
    \ string is compliant with a particular grammar, or not. jGoslin uses the Goslin\
    \ grammars and the generated parser to support the following general tasks. 1)\
    \ Facilitate the parsing of shorthand lipid names dialects. 2) Provide a structural\
    \ representation of the shorthand lipid after parsing. 3) Use the structural representation\
    \ to generate normalized names.\n"

  notes: 'jgoslin is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.

    This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default

    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can

    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS

    set globally this will take precedence.

    For example run it with "jgoslin -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
