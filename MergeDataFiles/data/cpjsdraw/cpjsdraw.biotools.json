                "abstract": "Background. Chloroplast genomes are usually circular molecules, and most of them are tetrad structures with two inverted repeat (IR) regions, a large single-copy region, and a small single-copy region. IR contraction and expansion are among the genetic diversities during the evolution of plant chloroplast genomes. The only previously released tool for the visualization of junction sites of the regions does not consider the diversity of the starting point of genomes, which leads to incorrect results or even no results for the examination of IR contraction and expansion. Results. In this work, a new tool named CPJSdraw was developed for visualizing the junction sites of chloroplast genomes. CPJSdraw can format the starting point of the irregular linearized genome, correct the junction sites of IR and single-copy regions, display the tetrad structure, visualize the junction sites of any number (â‰¥1) of chloroplast genomes, show the transcription direction of genes adjacent to junction sites, and indicate the IR expansion or contraction of chloroplast genomes. Conclusions. CPJSdraw is a software that is universal and reliable in analysis and visualization of IR expansion or contraction of chloroplast genomes. CPJSdraw has more accurate analysis and more complete functions when compared with previously released tool. CPJSdraw as a perl package and tested data are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7669480 for English users. In addition, an online version with a Chinese interface is available at http://cloud.genepioneer.com:9929/#/tool/alltool/detail/335.",
