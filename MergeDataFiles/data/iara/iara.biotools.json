                "abstract": "Splicing is one of the most important post-transcriptional processing systems and is responsible for the generation of transcriptome diversity in all living eukaryotes. Splicing is regulated by the spliceosome machinery, which is responsible for each step of primary RNA processing. However, current molecules and stages involved in RNA splicing are still spread over different studies. Thus, a curated atlas of spliceosome-related molecules and all involved stages during RNA processing can provide all researchers with a reliable resource to better investigate this important mechanism. Here, we present IARA (website access: https://pucpr-bioinformatics.github.io/atlas/), an extensively curated and constantly updated catalog of molecules involved in spliceosome machinery. IARA has a map of the steps involved in the human splicing mechanism, and it allows a detailed overview of the molecules involved throughout the distinct steps of splicing.",
