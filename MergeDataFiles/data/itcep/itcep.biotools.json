                "abstract": "Neoantigens recognized by cytotoxic T cells are effective targets for tumor-specific immune responses for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Quite a few neoantigen identification pipelines and computational strategies have been developed to improve the accuracy of the peptide selection process. However, these methods mainly consider the neoantigen end and ignore the interaction between peptide-TCR and the preference of each residue in TCRs, resulting in the filtered peptides often fail to truly elicit an immune response. Here, we propose a novel encoding approach for peptide-TCR representation. Subsequently, a deep learning framework, namely iTCep, was developed to predict the interactions between peptides and TCRs using fusion features derived from a feature-level fusion strategy. The iTCep achieved high predictive performance with AUC up to 0.96 on the testing dataset and above 0.86 on independent datasets, presenting better prediction performance compared with other predictors. Our results provided strong evidence that model iTCep can be a reliable and robust method for predicting TCR binding specificities of given antigen peptides. One can access the iTCep through a user-friendly web server at http://biostatistics.online/iTCep/, which supports prediction modes of peptide-TCR pairs and peptide-only. A stand-alone software program for T cell epitope prediction is also available for convenient installing at https://github.com/kbvstmd/iTCep/.",
