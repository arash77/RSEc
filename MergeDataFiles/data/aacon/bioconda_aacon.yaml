  description: AACon is a set of tools implementing 17 different conservation scores
    reviewed by Valdar as well as the more complex SMERFS algorithm for predicting
    protein functional sites. AACon has been written with efficiency in mind and takes
    less than a second to calculate conservation by all 18 methods for an alignment
    of 500 sequences 350 residues long on a single CPU. AACon exploits parallelism
    for the more demanding methods and to allow multiple methods to run simultaneously.
    The parallel code gives close to linear speedup with the number of processors,
    thus making it suitable for server applications or other demanding environments.

  notes: AACon is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script. The
    shell wrapper is called "aacon" and is present on $PATH by default. The Java program
    is executed with java specified by the $JAVA_HOME variable. Otherwise, a "java"
    program from the current environment is used.
