Users provide as input the search terms, set the desired level of ontological enrichment, and obtain as output the identity of matching data files at the various sources.\n\nWe integrated about 40 million metadata of several major valuable data sources, including four providers of clinical and experimental data (TCGA, ENCODE, 1000 Genomes, and Roadmap Epigenomics) and two sources of annotation data (GENCODE and RefSeq).",

                "abstract": "A wealth of public data repositories is available to drive genomics and clinical research. However, there is no agreement among the various data formats and models; in the common practice, data sources are accessed one by one, learning their specific descriptions with tedious efforts. In this context, the integration of genomic data and of their describing metadata becomes—at the same time—an important, difficult, and well-recognized challenge. In this chapter, after overviewing the most important human genomic data players, we propose a conceptual model of metadata and an extended architecture for integrating datasets, retrieved from a variety of data sources, based upon a structured transformation process; we then describe a user-friendly search system providing access to the resulting consolidated repository, enriched by a multi-ontology knowledge base. Inspired by our work on genomic data integration, during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak we successfully re-applied the previously proposed model-build-search paradigm, building on the analogies among the human and viral genomics domains. The availability of conceptual models, related databases, and search systems for both humans and viruses will provide important opportunities for research, especially if virus data will be connected to its host, provider of genomic and phenotype information.",

We implemented GenoSurf, a multi-ontology semantic search system providing access to a consolidated collection of metadata attributes found in the most relevant genomic datasets; values of 10 attributes are semantically enriched by making use of the most suited available ontologies. The user of GenoSurf provides as input the search terms, sets the desired level of ontological enrichment and obtains as output the identity of matching data files at the various sources. Search is facilitated by drop-down lists of matching values; aggregate counts describing resulting files are updated in real time while the search terms are progressively added. In addition to the consolidated attributes, users can perform keyword-based searches on the original (raw) metadata, which are also imported; GenoSurf supports the interplay of attribute-based and keyword-based search through well-defined interfaces. Currently, GenoSurf integrates about 40 million metadata of several major valuable data sources, including three providers of clinical and experimental data (TCGA, ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics) and two sources of annotation data (GENCODE and RefSeq); it can be used as a standalone resource for targeting the genomic datasets at their original sources (identified with their accession IDs and URLs), or as part of an integrated query answering system for performing complex queries over genomic regions and metadata.",
