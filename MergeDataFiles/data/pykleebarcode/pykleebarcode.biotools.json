                "abstract": "As biological sequence databases continue growing, so do the insight that they promise to shed on the shape of the genetic diversity of life. However, to fulfil this promise the software must remain usable, be able to accommodate a large amount of data and allow use of modern high performance computing infrastructure. In this study we present a reimplementation as well as an extension of a technique using indicator vectors to compute and visualize similarities between sets of nucleotide sequences. We have a flexible and easy to use python program relying on standard and open-source libraries. Our tool allows analysis of very large complement of sequences using code parallelization, as well as by providing routines to split a computational task in smaller and manageable subtasks whose results are then merged. This implementation also facilitates adding new sequences into an indicator vectorbased representation without re-computing the whole set. The efficient synthesis of data into knowledge is no trivial matter given the size and rapid growth of biological sequence databases. Based on previous results regarding the properties of indicator vectors, the open-source approach proposed here efficiently and flexibly supports comparative analysis of genetic diversity at a large scale.",
