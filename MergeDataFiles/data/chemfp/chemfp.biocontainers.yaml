description: Chemfp is a set of command-lines tools for generating cheminformatics
  fingerprints and searching those fingerprints by tanimoto similarity, as well as
  a python library which can be used to build new tools. these algorithms are designed
  for the dense, 100-10,000 bit fingerprints which occur in small-molecule pharmaceutical
  nchemisty. the tanimoto search algorithms are implemented in c for performance and
  support both threshold and k-nearest searches.fingerprint generation can be done
  either by extracting existing fingerprint data from an sd file or by using an existing
  chemistry toolkit. chemfp supports the python libraries from open babel, nopeneye,
  and rdkit toolkits.
