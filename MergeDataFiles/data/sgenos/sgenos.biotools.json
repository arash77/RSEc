                "abstract": "Host-pathogen interaction is the most crucial factor that evokes the host immune system to fight against pathogens. In contrast to specialized immune cells present in humans and animals, plants have disease resistance (R-) and disease susceptibility (S-) genes. R-genes confer disease resistance and are generally introgressed from wild crop relatives to cultivated crops. S-genes, on the other hand, assist pathogens in establishing contact, displaying counter-defense measures, and spreading the infection. To achieve resistance in a variety of crops, researchers are now focusing on the identification, silencing, editing, or elimination of crucial S-genes. To aid in this field, we created the first curated database of disease susceptibility genes in plants (DSP), with the simple and advanced search tool that allows researchers to restrict the query and mining of specified hits. SSR marker identification and primer designing could be performed with the help of MISA and Primer3 software, respectively. The DSP database is available at http://45.248.163.60/bic/sgenos/ and http://14.139.62.220/sgenos/ .",
