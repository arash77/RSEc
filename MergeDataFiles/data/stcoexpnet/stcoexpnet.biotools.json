                "abstract": "Key message: We constructed a gene expression atlas and co-expression network for potatoes and identified several novel genes associated with various agronomic traits. This resource will accelerate potato genetics and genomics research. Abstract: Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the world's most crucial non-cereal food crop and ranks third in food production after wheat and rice. Despite the availability of several potato transcriptome datasets at public databases like NCBI SRA, an effort has yet to be put into developing a global transcriptome atlas and a co-expression network for potatoes. The objectives of our study were to construct a global expression atlas for potatoes using publicly available transcriptome datasets, identify housekeeping and tissue-specific genes, construct a global co-expression network and identify co-expression clusters, investigate the transcriptional complexity of genes involved in various essential biological processes related to agronomic traits, and provide a web server (StCoExpNet) to easily access the newly constructed expression atlas and co-expression network to investigate the expression and co-expression of genes of interest. In this study, we used data from 2299 publicly available potato transcriptome samples obtained from 15 different tissues to construct a global transcriptome atlas. We found that roughly 87% of the annotated genes exhibited detectable expression in at least one sample. Among these, we identified 281 genes with consistent and stable expression levels, indicating their role as housekeeping genes. Conversely, 308 genes exhibited marked tissue-specific expression patterns. We exemplarily linked some co-expression clusters to important agronomic traits of potatoes, such as self-incompatibility, anthocyanin biosynthesis, tuberization, and defense responses against multiple pathogens. The dataset compiled here constitutes a new resource (StCoExpNet), which can be accessed at https://stcoexpnet.julius-kuehn.de. This transcriptome atlas and the co-expression network will accelerate potato genetics and genomics research.",
