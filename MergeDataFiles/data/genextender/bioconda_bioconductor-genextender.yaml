  description: geneXtendeR optimizes the functional annotation of ChIP-seq peaks by
    exploring relative differences in annotating ChIP-seq peak sets to variable-length
    gene bodies.  In contrast to prior techniques, geneXtendeR considers peak annotations
    beyond just the closest gene, allowing users to see peak summary statistics for
    the first-closest gene, second-closest gene, ..., n-closest gene whilst ranking
    the output according to biologically relevant events and iteratively comparing
    the fidelity of peak-to-gene overlap across a user-defined range of upstream and
    downstream extensions on the original boundaries of each gene's coordinates.  Since
    different ChIP-seq peak callers produce different differentially enriched peaks
    with a large variance in peak length distribution and total peak count, annotating
    peak lists with their nearest genes can often be a noisy process.  As such, the
    goal of geneXtendeR is to robustly link differentially enriched peaks with their
    respective genes, thereby aiding experimental follow-up and validation in designing
    primers for a set of prospective gene candidates during qPCR.
