about:
  description: This LPE library is used to do significance analysis of microarray
    data with small number of replicates. It uses resampling based FDR adjustment,
    and gives less conservative results than traditional 'BH' or 'BY' procedures.
    Data accepted is raw data in txt format from MAS4, MAS5 or dChip. Data can also
    be supplied after normalization. LPE library is primarily used for analyzing data
    between two conditions. To use it for paired data, see LPEP library. For using
    LPE in multiple conditions, use HEM library.
