description: The genome analysis toolkit (gatk) is a set of bioinformatic tools for
  analyzing high-throughput sequencing (hts) and variant call format (vcf) data. the
  toolkit is well established for germline short variant discovery from whole genome
  and exome sequencing data. gatk4 expands functionality into copy number and somatic
  analyses and offers pipeline scripts for workflows.
