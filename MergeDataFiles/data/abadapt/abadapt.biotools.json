                "abstract": "Motivation: The scoring of antibody-antigen docked poses starting from unbound homology models has not been systematically optimized for a large and diverse set of input sequences. Results: To address this need, we have developed AbAdapt, a webserver that accepts antibody and antigen sequences, models their 3D structures, predicts epitope and paratope, and then docks the modeled structures using two established docking engines (Piper and Hex). Each of the key steps has been optimized by developing and training new machine-learning models. The sequences from a diverse set of 622 antibody-antigen pairs with known structure were used as inputs for leave-one-out cross-validation. The final set of cluster representatives included at least one 'Adequate' pose for 550/622 (88.4%) of the queries. The median (interquartile range) ranks of these 'Adequate' poses were 22 (5-77). Similar results were obtained on a holdout set of 100 unrelated antibody-antigen pairs. When epitopes were repredicted using docking-derived features for specific antibodies, the median ROC AUC increased from 0.679 to 0.720 in cross-validation and from 0.694 to 0.730 in the holdout set.",
