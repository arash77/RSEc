                "abstract": "During the production and processing of tea, harmful substances are often introduced. However, they have never been systematically integrated, and it is impossible to understand the harmful substances that may be introduced during tea production and their related relationships when searching for papers. To address these issues, a database on tea risk substances and their research relationships was constructed. These data were correlated by knowledge mapping techniques, and a Neo4j graph database centered on tea risk substance research was constructed, containing 4189 nodes and 9400 correlations (e.g. research category-PMID, risk substance category-PMID, and risk substance-PMID). This is the first knowledge-based graph database that is specifically designed for integrating and analyzing risk substances in tea and related research, containing nine main types of tea risk substances (including a comprehensive discussion of inclusion pollutants, heavy metals, pesticides, environmental pollutants, mycotoxins, microorganisms, radioactive isotopes, plant growth regulators, and others) and six types of tea research papers (including reviews, safety evaluations/risk assessments, prevention and control measures, detection methods, residual/pollution situations, and data analysis/data measurement). It is an essential reference for exploring the causes of the formation of risk substances in tea and the safety standards of tea in the future. Database URL http://trsrd.wpengxs.cn",
