                "abstract": "Synthetic lethality (SL) occurs when mutations in two genes together lead to cell or organism death, while a single mutation in either gene does not have a significant impact. This concept can also be extended to three or more genes for SL. Computational and experimental methods have been developed to predict and verify SL gene pairs, especially for yeast and Escherichia coli. However, there is currently a lack of a specialized platform to collect microbial SL gene pairs. Therefore, we designed a synthetic interaction database for microbial genetics that collects 13,313 SL and 2,994 Synthetic Rescue (SR) gene pairs that are reported in the literature, as well as 86,981 putative SL pairs got through homologous transfer method in 281 bacterial genomes. Our database website provides multiple functions such as search, browse, visualization, and Blast. Based on the SL interaction data in the S. cerevisiae, we review the issue of duplicationsâ€™ essentiality and observed that the duplicated genes and singletons have a similar ratio of being essential when we consider both individual and SL. The Microbial Synthetic Lethal and Rescue Database (Mslar) is expected to be a useful reference resource for researchers interested in the SL and SR genes of microorganisms. Mslar is open freely to everyone and available on the web at http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/Mslar/.",
