                "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an effective tool to accelerate drug discovery and cut costs in discovery processes. Many successful AI applications are reported in the early stages of small molecule drug discovery. However, most of those applications require a deep understanding of software and hardware, and focus on a single field that implies data normalization and transfer between those applications is still a challenge for normal users. It usually limits the application of AI in drug discovery. Here, based on a series of robust models, we formed a one-stop, general purpose, and AI-based drug discovery platform, MolProphet, to provide complete functionalities in the early stages of small molecule drug discovery, including AI-based target pocket prediction, hit discovery and lead optimization, and compound targeting, as well as abundant analyzing tools to check the results. MolProphet is an accessible and user-friendly web-based platform that is fully designed according to the practices in the drug discovery industry. The molecule screened, generated, or optimized by the MolProphet is purchasable and synthesizable at low cost but with good drug-likeness. More than 400 users from industry and academia have used MolProphet in their work. We hope this platform can provide a powerful solution to assist each normal researcher in drug design and related research areas. It is available for everyone at https://www.molprophet.com/.",
