The process can be studied by computational means with variable degrees of precision.

Here we introduce pyCaverDock, a Python3 API designed to improve user experience with the tool and further facilitate the ligand transport analyses. The API enables users to simplify the steps needed to use CaverDock, from automatizing setup processes to designing screening pipelines.",
