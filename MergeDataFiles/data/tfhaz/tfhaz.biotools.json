    "description": "It finds trascription factor (TF) high accumulation DNA zones, i.e., regions along the genome where there is a high presence of different transcription factors. Starting from a dataset containing the genomic positions of TF binding regions, for each base of the selected chromosome the accumulation of TFs is computed. Two different methods for the search of TF high accumulation DNA zones, called \"binding regions\" and \"overlaps\", are available.",

                "abstract": "Background: Transcription factors (TF) play a crucial role in the regulation of gene transcription; alterations of their activity and binding to DNA areas are strongly involved in cancer and other disease onset and development. For proper biomedical investigation, it is hence essential to correctly trace TF dense DNA areas, having multiple bindings of distinct factors, and select DNA high occupancy target (HOT) zones, showing the highest accumulation of such bindings. Indeed, systematic and replicable analysis of HOT zones in a large variety of cells and tissues would allow further understanding of their characteristics and could clarify their functional role. Results: Here, we propose, thoroughly explain and discuss a full computational procedure to study in-depth DNA dense areas of transcription factor accumulation and identify HOT zones. This methodology, developed as a computationally efficient parametric algorithm implemented in an R/Bioconductor package, uses a systematic approach with two alternative methods to examine transcription factor bindings and provide comparative and fully-reproducible assessments. It offers different resolutions by introducing three distinct types of accumulation, which can analyze DNA from single-base to region-oriented levels, and a moving window, which can estimate the influence of the neighborhood for each DNA base under exam. Conclusions: We quantitatively assessed the full procedure by using our implemented software package, named TFHAZ, in two example applications of biological interest, proving its full reliability and relevance.",
