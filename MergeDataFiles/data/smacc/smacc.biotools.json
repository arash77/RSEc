We have identified, collected, curated, and integrated all chemogenomics data from ChEMBL for 13 emerging viruses that hold the greatest potential threat to global human health. By identifying and solving several challenges related to data annotation accuracy, we developed a highly curated and thoroughly annotated database of compounds tested in both phenotypic and target-based assays for these viruses that we dubbed SMACC (Small Molecule Antiviral Compound Collection). The pilot version of the SMACC database contains over 32,500 entries for 13 viruses. By analyzing data in SMACC, we have identified âˆ¼50 compounds with polyviral inhibition profile, mostly covering flavi- and coronaviruses. The SMACC database may serve as a reference for virologists and medicinal chemists working on the development of novel BSA agents in preparation for future viral outbreaks. SMACC is publicly available at https://smacc.mml.unc.edu.",
