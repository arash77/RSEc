                "abstract": "Backgroud: CRISPR/Cas is an efficient genome editing system that has been widely used for functional genetic studies and exhibits high potential in biomedical translational applications. Indel analysis has thus become one of the most common practices in the lab to evaluate DNA editing events generated by CRISPR/Cas. Several indel analysis tools have been reported, however, it is often required that users have certain bioinformatics training and basic command-line processing capability. Results: Here, we developed CRISPR-GRANT, a stand-alone graphical CRISPR indel analysis tool, which could be easily installed for multi-platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. CRISPR-GRANT offered a straightforward GUI by simple click-and-run for genome editing analysis of single or pooled amplicons and one-step analysis for whole-genome sequencing without the need of data pre-processing, making it ideal for novice lab scientists. Moreover, it also exhibited shorter run-time compared with tools currently available. Conclusion: Therefore, CRISPR-GRANT is a valuable addition to the current CRISPR toolkits that significantly lower the barrier for wet-lab researchers to conduct indel analysis from large NGS datasets. CRISPR-GRANT binaries are freely available for Linux (above Ubuntu 16.04), macOS (above High Sierra 10.13) and Windows (above Windows 7) at https://github.com/fuhuancheng/CRISPR-GRANT . CRISPR-GRANT source code is licensed under the GPLv3 license and free to download and use.",
