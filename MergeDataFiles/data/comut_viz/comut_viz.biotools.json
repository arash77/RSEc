                "abstract": "Background: Comutation plot is a widely used visualization method to deliver a global view of the mutation landscape of large-scale genomic studies. Current tools for creating comutation plot are either offline packages that require coding or online web servers with varied features. When a package is used, it often requires repetitive runs of code to adjust a single feature that might only be a few clicks in a web app. But web apps mostly have limited capacity for customization and cannot handle very large genomic files. Results: To improve on existing tools, we identified features that are most frequently adjusted in creating a plot and incorporate them in Comut-viz that interactively filters and visualizes mutation data as downloadable plots. It includes colored labels for numeric metadata, a preloaded palette for changing colors and two input boxes for adjusting width and height. It accepts standard mutation annotation format (MAF) files as input and can handle large MAF files with more than 200 k rows. As a front-end only app, Comut-viz guarantees privacy of user data and no latency in the analysis. Conclusions: Comut-viz is a highly responsive and extensible web app to make comutation plots. It provides customization for frequently adjusted features and accepts large genomic files as input. It is suitable for genomic studies with more than a thousand samples.",
