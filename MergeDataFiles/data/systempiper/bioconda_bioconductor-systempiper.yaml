about:
  description: systemPipeR is a multipurpose data analysis workflow environment that
    unifies R with command-line tools. It enables scientists to analyze many types
    of large- or small-scale data on local or distributed computer systems with a
    high level of reproducibility, scalability and portability. At its core is a command-line
    interface (CLI) that adopts the Common Workflow Language (CWL). This design allows
    users to choose for each analysis step the optimal R or command-line software.
    It supports both end-to-end and partial execution of workflows with built-in restart
    functionalities. Efficient management of complex analysis tasks is accomplished
    by a flexible workflow control container class. Handling of large numbers of input
    samples and experimental designs is facilitated by consistent sample annotation
    mechanisms. As a multi-purpose workflow toolkit, systemPipeR enables users to
    run existing workflows, customize them or design entirely new ones while taking
    advantage of widely adopted data structures within the Bioconductor ecosystem.
    Another important core functionality is the generation of reproducible scientific
    analysis and technical reports. For result interpretation, systemPipeR offers
    a wide range of plotting functionality, while an associated Shiny App offers many
    useful functionalities for interactive result exploration. The vignettes linked
    from this page include (1) a general introduction, (2) a description of technical
    details, and (3) a collection of workflow templates.
