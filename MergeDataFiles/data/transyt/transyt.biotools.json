                "abstract": "Motivation: The importance and rate of development of genome-scale metabolic models have been growing for the last few years, increasing the demand for software solutions that automate several steps of this process. However, since TRIAGE's release, software development for the automatic integration of transport reactions into models has stalled. Results: Here, we present the Transport Systems Tracker (TranSyT). Unlike other transport systems annotation software, TranSyT does not rely on manual curation to expand its internal database, which is derived from highly curated records retrieved from the Transporters Classification Database and complemented with information from other data sources. TranSyT compiles information regarding transporter families and proteins, and derives reactions into its internal database, making it available for rapid annotation of complete genomes. All transport reactions have GPR associations and can be exported with identifiers from four different metabolite databases. TranSyT is currently available as a plugin for merlin v4.0 and an app for KBase.",
