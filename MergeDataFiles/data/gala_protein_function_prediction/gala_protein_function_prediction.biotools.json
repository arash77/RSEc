    "description": "Software tool for protein function prediction. Extracts information from both protein sequences and structures, facilitating unified learning of protein structural representations. GALA incorporates domain discriminator conditioned on both representations and predicted probabilities, which undergoes adversarial training to ensure representation invariance across diverse environments.",
