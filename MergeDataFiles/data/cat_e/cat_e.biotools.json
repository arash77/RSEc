                "abstract": "Identifying potential cancer-associated genes and drug targets from omics data is challenging due to its diverse sources and analyses, requiring advanced skills and large amounts of time. To facilitate such analysis, we developed Cat-E (Cancer Target Explorer), a novel R/Shiny web tool designed for comprehensive analysis with evaluation according to cancer-related omics data. Cat-E is accessible at https://cat-e.bioinfo-wuerz.eu/. Cat-E compiles information on oncolytic viruses, cell lines, gene markers, and clinical studies by integrating molecular datasets from key databases such as OvirusTB, TCGA, DrugBANK, and PubChem. Users can use all datasets and upload their data to perform multiple analyses, such as differential gene expression analysis, metabolic pathway exploration, metabolic flux analysis, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, survival analysis, immune signature analysis, single nucleotide variation analysis, dynamic analysis of gene expression changes and gene regulatory network changes, and protein structure prediction. Cancer target evaluation by Cat-E is demonstrated here on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) datasets. By offering a user-friendly interface and detailed user manual, Cat-E eliminates the need for advanced computational expertise, making it accessible to experimental biologists, undergraduate and graduate students, and oncology clinicians. It serves as a valuable tool for investigating genetic variations across diverse cancer types, facilitating the identification of novel diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets.",
