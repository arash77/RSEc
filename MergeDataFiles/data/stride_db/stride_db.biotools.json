                "abstract": "Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) are genetic markers made up of repeating DNA sequences. The variations of the STRs are widely studied in forensic analysis, population studies and genetic testing for a variety of neuromuscular disorders. Understanding polymorphic STR variation and its cause is crucial for deciphering genetic information and finding links to various disorders. In this paper, we present STRIDE-DB, a novel and unique platform to explore STR Instability and its Phenotypic Relevance, and a comprehensive database of STRs in the human genome. We utilized RepeatMasker to identify all the STRs in the human genome (hg19) and combined it with frequency data from the 1000 Genomes Project. STRIDE-DB, a user-friendly resource, plays a pivotal role in investigating the relationship between STR variation, instability and phenotype. By harnessing data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), ClinVar database, Alu loci, Haploblocks in genome and Conservation of the STRs, it serves as an important tool for researchers exploring the variability of STRs in the human genome and its direct impact on phenotypes. STRIDE-DB has its broad applicability and significance in various research domains like forensic sciences and other repeat expansion disorders.",
