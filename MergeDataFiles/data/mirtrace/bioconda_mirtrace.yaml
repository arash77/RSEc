  summary: "miRTrace is a new quality control and taxonomic tracing tool developed\
    \ specifically for small RNA sequencing data (sRNA-Seq). \nEach sample is characterized\
    \ by profiling sequencing quality, read length, sequencing depth and miRNA complexity\
    \ and also the \namounts of miRNAs versus undesirable sequences (derived from\
    \ tRNAs, rRNAs and sequencing artifacts). In addition to these routine \nquality\
    \ control (QC) analyses, miRTrace can accurately and sensitively resolve taxonomic\
    \ origins of small RNA-Seq data based on the \ncomposition of clade-specific miRNAs.\
    \ This feature can be used to detect cross-clade contaminations in typical lab\
    \ settings. It can \nalso be applied for more specific applications in forensics,\
    \ food quality control and clinical diagnosis, for instance tracing the \norigins\
    \ of meat products or detecting parasitic microRNAs in host serum.\n"
