                "abstract": "The utilization of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) for B-cell receptor (BCR) immune repertoire analysis has become widespread in the fields of adaptive immunity and antibody drug development. However, the sheer volume of sequences generated by these experiments presents a challenge in data processing. Specifically, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), a critical aspect of BCR analysis, remains inadequate for handling massive BCR sequencing data and lacks the ability to provide immunoglobulin-specific information. To address this gap, we introduce Abalign, a standalone program specifically designed for ultrafast MSA of BCR/antibody sequences. Benchmark tests demonstrate that Abalign achieves comparable or even better accuracy than state-of-the-art MSA tools, and shows remarkable advantages in terms of speed and memory consumption, reducing the time required for high-throughput analysis from weeks to hours. In addition to its alignment capabilities, Abalign offers a broad range of BCR analysis features, including extracting BCRs, constructing lineage trees, assigning VJ genes, analyzing clonotypes, profiling mutations, and comparing BCR immune repertoires. With its user-friendly graphic interface, Abalign can be easily run on personal computers instead of computing clusters. Overall, Abalign is an easy-to-use and effective tool that enables researchers to analyze massive BCR/antibody sequences, leading to new discoveries in the field of immunoinformatics.
