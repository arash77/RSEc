                "abstract": "Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX/MS) is increasingly used to study the dynamics of protein conformation. Coupled to native MS, HDX can also characterize the conformations of oligonucleotides and their binding to cations, small molecules, and proteins. Data processing and visualization of native HDX/MS of oligonucleotides requires dedicated software solutions. OligoR is a web-browser-based application that addresses the specific needs of DNA HDX/MS and native MS experiments from raw data in an open format to visualization and export of results. Whole experiments spanning many time points can be processed in minutes for several mass-separated species. To access valuable folding dynamics information, we have developed a simple and robust approach to deconvolute bimodal isotope distributions, even when they are highly overlapping. This approach is based on modeling physically possible isotope distributions determined from chemical formulae and could be extended to any type of analyte (proteins, peptides, sugars, and small molecules). All results are presented in interactive data tables, and publication-quality figures can be generated, customized, and exported.",
