about:
  description: A package with focus on analysis of discrete regions of the genome.
    This package is useful for investigation of one or a few genes using Affymetrix
    data, since it will extract probe level data using the Affymetrix Power Tools
    application and wrap these data into a ProbeLevelSet. A ProbeLevelSet directly
    extends the expressionSet, but includes additional information about the sequence
    of each probe and the probe set it is derived from. The package includes a number
    of functions used for plotting these probe level data as a function of location
    along sequences of mRNA-strands. This can be used for analysis of variable splicing,
    and is especially well suited for use with exon-array data.
