                "abstract": "Motivation: Tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) has proven effective for a wide range of bioinformatics applications ranging from biomarker identification to the identification of disease-causing genes and drug repositioning. However, TD-based unsupervised FE failed to gain widespread acceptance due to the lack of user-friendly tools for non-experts. Results: We developed two bioconductor packages—TDbasedUFE and TDbasedUFEadv—that enable researchers unfamiliar with TD to utilize TD-based unsupervised FE. The packages facilitate the identification of differentially expressed genes and multiomics analysis. TDbasedUFE was found to outperform two state-of-the-art methods, such as DESeq2 and DIABLO. Availability and implementation: TDbasedUFE and TDbasedUFEadv are freely available as R/Bioconductor packages, which can be accessed at https://bioconductor.org/packages/TDbasedUFE and https://bioconductor.org/packages/TDbasedUFEadv, respectively.",
