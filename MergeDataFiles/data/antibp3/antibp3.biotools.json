                "abstract": "Most of the existing methods developed for predicting antibacterial peptides (ABPs) are mostly designed to target either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we describe a method that allows us to predict ABPs against gram-positive, gram-negative, and gram-variable bacteria. Firstly, we developed an alignment-based approach using BLAST to identify ABPs and achieved poor sensitivity. Secondly, we employed a motif-based approach to predict ABPs and obtained high precision with low sensitivity. To address the issue of poor sensitivity, we developed alignment-free methods for predicting ABPs using machine/deep learning techniques. In the case of alignment-free methods, we utilized a wide range of peptide features that include different types of composition, binary profiles of terminal residues, and fastText word embedding. In this study, a five-fold cross-validation technique has been used to build machine/deep learning models on training datasets. These models were evaluated on an independent dataset with no common peptide between training and independent datasets. Our machine learning-based model developed using the amino acid binary profile of terminal residues achieved maximum AUC 0.93, 0.98, and 0.94 for gram-positive, gram-negative, and gram-variable bacteria, respectively, on an independent dataset. Our method performs better than existing methods when compared with existing approaches on an independent dataset. A user-friendly web server, standalone package and pip package have been developed to facilitate peptide-based therapeutics.",
