    "description": "DeepMRM is a targeted proteomics data interpretation package using deep-learning. It takes MRM, PRM, or Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) data and target list as input and outputs peaks of targeted peptides, along with their abundances and quality scores. The targeted endogenous (light) peptides are detected and quantified using their stable isotope labeled (heavy) peptides.",

We introduce DeepMRM, a software package based on deep learning algorithms for object detection developed to minimize manual intervention in targeted proteomics data analysis. DeepMRM was evaluated on internal and public datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy compared with the community standard tool Skyline. To promote widespread adoption, we have incorporated a stand-alone graphical user interface for DeepMRM and integrated its algorithm into the Skyline software package as an external tool.",
