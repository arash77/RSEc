Program EPTool is the implementation of Bagging MSA Learning, which provides a complete training and evaluation workflow for the enhancing PSSM model. It is capable of handling different input data set and various computing algorithms to train the enhancing model, then eventually improve the PSSM quality for those proteins with insufficient homologous sequences. In addition, EPTool equips several convenient applications, such as PSSM features calculator, and PSSM features visualization. In this article, we propose designed EPTool and briefly introduce its functionalities and applications. The detailed accessible instructions are also provided.",
