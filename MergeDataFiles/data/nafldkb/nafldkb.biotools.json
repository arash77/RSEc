                "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease with a broad spectrum of histologic manifestations. The rapidly growing prevalence and the complex pathologic mechanisms of NAFLD pose great challenges for treatment development. Despite tremendous efforts devoted to drug development, there are no FDA-approved medicines yet. Here, we present NAFLDkb, a specialized knowledge base and platform for computer-aided drug design against NAFLD. With multiperspective information curated from diverse source materials and public databases, NAFLDkb presents the associations of drug-related entities as individual knowledge graphs. Practical drug discovery tools that facilitate the utilization and expansion of NAFLDkb have also been implemented in the web interface, including chemical structure search, drug-likeness screening, knowledge-based repositioning, and research article annotation. Moreover, case studies of a knowledge graph repositioning model and a generative neural network model are presented herein, where three repositioning drug candidates and 137 novel lead-like compounds were newly established as NAFLD pharmacotherapy options reusing data records and machine learning tools in NAFLDkb, suggesting its clinical reliability and great potential in identifying novel drug-disease associations of NAFLD and generating new insights to accelerate NAFLD drug development. NAFLDkb is freely accessible at https://www.biosino.org/nafldkb and will be updated periodically with the latest findings.",
