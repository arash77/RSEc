                "abstract": "Motivation: Coiled-coil domains (CCD) are widespread in all organisms and perform several crucial functions. Given their relevance, the computational detection of CCD is very important for protein functional annotation. State-of-the-art prediction methods include the precise identification of CCD boundaries, the annotation of the typical heptad repeat pattern along the coiled-coil helices as well as the prediction of the oligomerization state. Results: In this article, we describe CoCoNat, a novel method for predicting coiled-coil helix boundaries, residue-level register annotation, and oligomerization state. Our method encodes sequences with the combination of two state-of-the-art protein language models and implements a three-step deep learning procedure concatenated with a Grammatical-Restrained Hidden Conditional Random Field for CCD identification and refinement. A final neural network predicts the oligomerization state. When tested on a blind test set routinely adopted, CoCoNat obtains a performance superior to the current state-of-the-art both for residue-level and segment-level CCD. CoCoNat significantly outperforms the most recent state-of-the-art methods on register annotation and prediction of oligomerization states.",

                "abstract": "Coiled-coil domains (CCDs) are structural motifs observed in proteins in all organisms that perform several crucial functions. The computational identification of CCD segments over a protein sequence is of great importance for its functional characterization. This task can essentially be divided into three separate steps: the detection of segment boundaries, the annotation of the heptad repeat pattern along the segment, and the classification of its oligomerization state. Several methods have been proposed over the years addressing one or more of these predictive steps. In this protocol, we illustrate how to make use of CoCoNat, a novel approach based on protein language models, to characterize CCDs. CoCoNat is, at its release (August 2023), the state of the art for CCD detection. The web server allows users to submit input protein sequences and visualize the predicted domains after a few minutes. Optionally, precomputed segments can be provided to the model, which will predict the oligomerization state for each of them. CoCoNat can be easily integrated into biological pipelines by downloading the standalone version, which provides a single executable script to produce the output.",
