  description: Distance-correlation based Gene Set Analysis for longitudinal gene
    expression profiles. In longitudinal studies, the gene expression profiles were
    collected at each visit from each subject and hence there are multiple measurements
    of the gene expression profiles for each subject. The dcGSA package could be used
    to assess the associations between gene sets and clinical outcomes of interest
    by fully taking advantage of the longitudinal nature of both the gene expression
    profiles and clinical outcomes.
