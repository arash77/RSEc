                "abstract": "Antibodies with similar amino acid sequences, especially across their complementarity-determining regions, often share properties. Finding that an antibody of interest has a similar sequence to naturally expressed antibodies in healthy or diseased repertoires is a powerful approach for the prediction of antibody properties, such as immunogenicity or antigen specificity. However, as the number of available antibody sequences is now in the billions and continuing to grow, repertoire mining for similar sequences has become increasingly computationally expensive. Existing approaches are limited by either being low-throughput, non-exhaustive, not antibody specific, or only searching against entire chain sequences. Therefore, there is a need for a specialized tool, optimized for a rapid and exhaustive search of any antibody region against all known antibodies, to better utilize the full breadth of available repertoire sequences. We introduce Known Antibody Search (KA-Search), a tool that allows for the rapid search of billions of antibody variable domains by amino acid sequence identity across either the variable domain, the complementarity-determining regions, or a user defined antibody region. We show KA-Search in operation on the âˆ¼ 2.4 billion antibody sequences available in the OAS database. KA-Search can be used to find the most similar sequences from OAS within 30 minutes and a representative subset of 10 million sequences in less than 9 seconds. We give examples of how KA-Search can be used to obtain new insights about an antibody of interest. KA-Search is freely available at https://github.com/oxpig/kasearch .",
