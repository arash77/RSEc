about:
  description: Large data files can be difficult to work with in R, where data generally
    resides in memory. This package encourages a style of programming where data is
    'streamed' from disk into R via a `producer' and through a series of `consumers'
    that, typically reduce the original data to a manageable size. The package provides
    useful Producer and Consumer stream components for operations such as data input,
    sampling, indexing, and transformation; see package?Streamer for details.
