    "description": "ARTEM is a tool for the superposition of two arbitrary RNA 3D structure fragments.\nARTEM doesnâ€™t rely on sequence similarity, annotated interactions, or backbone topology. Instead, ARTEM assumes at least one residue-residue match has a close-to-zero RMSD in the ideal superposition. Then, ARTEM tries all N*M single-residue matches and derives a subset of mutually closest residues as the matches for each of the single-residue-based superpositions. Finally, ARTEM returns the superpositions ordered by their size, letting the user choose the best one based on any specific requirements. ARTEM can read/write both PDB and mmCIF format.",

                "abstract": "Understanding the 3D structure of RNA is key to understanding RNA function. RNA 3D structure is modular and can be seen as a composition of building blocks of various sizes called tertiary motifs. Currently, long-range motifs formed between distant loops and helical regions are largely less studied than the local motifs determined by the RNA secondary structure. We surveyed long-range tertiary interactions and motifs in a non-redundant set of non-coding RNA 3D structures. A new dataset of annotated LOng-RAnge RNA 3D modules (LORA) was built using an approach that does not rely on the automatic annotations of non-canonical interactions. An original algorithm, ARTEM, was developed for annotation-, sequence- and topology-independent superposition of two arbitrary RNA 3D modules. The proposed methods allowed us to identify and describe the most common long-range RNA tertiary motifs. Along with the prevalent canonical A-minor interactions, a large number of previously undescribed staple interactions were observed. The most frequent long-range motifs were found to belong to three main motif families: planar staples, tilted staples, and helical packing motifs.",
