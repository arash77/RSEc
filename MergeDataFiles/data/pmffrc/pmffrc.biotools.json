                "abstract": "Background: Genomic sequencing reads compressors are essential for balancing high-throughput sequencing short reads generation speed, large-scale genomic data sharing, and infrastructure storage expenditure. However, most existing short reads compressors rarely utilize big-memory systems and duplicative information between diverse sequencing files to achieve a higher compression ratio for conserving reads data storage space. Results: We employ compression ratio as the optimization objective and propose a large-scale genomic sequencing short reads data compression optimizer, named PMFFRC, through novelty memory modeling and redundant reads clustering technologies. By cascading PMFFRC, in 982 GB fastq format sequencing data, with 274 GB and 3.3 billion short reads, the state-of-the-art and reference-free compressors HARC, SPRING, Mstcom, and FastqCLS achieve 77.89%, 77.56%, 73.51%, and 29.36% average maximum compression ratio gains, respectively. PMFFRC saves 39.41%, 41.62%, 40.99%, and 20.19% of storage space sizes compared with the four unoptimized compressors. Conclusions: PMFFRC rational usage big-memory of compression server, effectively saving the sequencing reads data storage space sizes, which relieves the basic storage facilities costs and community sharing transmitting overhead. Our work furnishes a novel solution for improving sequencing reads compression and saving storage space. The proposed PMFFRC algorithm is packaged in a same-name Linux toolkit, available un-limited at https://github.com/fahaihi/PMFFRC .",
