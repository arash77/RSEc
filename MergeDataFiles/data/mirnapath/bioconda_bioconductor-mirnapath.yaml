about:
  description: This package provides pathway enrichment techniques for miRNA expression
    data. Specifically, the set of methods handles the many-to-many relationship between
    miRNAs and the multiple genes they are predicted to target (and thus affect.)  It
    also handles the gene-to-pathway relationships separately. Both steps are designed
    to preserve the additive effects of miRNAs on genes, many miRNAs affecting one
    gene, one miRNA affecting multiple genes, or many miRNAs affecting many genes.
