                "abstract": "Immunotherapy is a rapidly growing therapy for cancer which have numerous benefits over conventional treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Overall survival of cancer patients has improved significantly due to the use of immunotherapy. It acts as a novel pillar for treating different malignancies from their primary to the metastatic stage. Recent preferments in high-throughput sequencing and computational immunology leads to the development of targeted immunotherapy for precision oncology. In the last few decades, several computational methods and resources have been developed for designing immunotherapy against cancer. In this review, we have summarized cancer-associated genomic, transcriptomic, and mutation profile repositories. We have also enlisted in silico methods for the prediction of vaccine candidates, HLA binders, cytokines inducing peptides, and potential neoepitopes. Of note, we have incorporated the most important bioinformatics pipelines and resources for the designing of cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, to facilitate the scientific community, we have developed a web portal entitled ImmCancer (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/immcancer/), comprises cancer immunotherapy tools and repositories.",
