On the clinical side, an application for managing and visualizing pedigree diagrams could provide genetics specialists with an integrated environment with potential positive impact on their current practice. This article presents a web tool (genoDraw) that provides clinical practitioners with the ability to create, maintain and visualize patients' and their families' information in the form of pedigree diagrams. genoDraw implements a graph-based three-step process for generating diagrams according to a de facto standard in the area and clinical terminologies. It also complies with five characteristics identified as indispensable for the next-generation of pedigree drawing software: comprehensiveness, data-drivenness, automation, interactivity and compatibility with biomedical vocabularies. The platform was implemented and tested, confirming its potential interest to clinical routine.",
