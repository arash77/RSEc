    "description": "ReMap is a large scale integrative analysis of DNA-binding experiments for Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptional regulators. The catalogues are the results of the manual curation of ChIP-seq, ChIP-exo, DAP-seq from public sources (GEO, ENCODE, ENA). ReMap (https://remap.univ-amu.fr) aims to provide manually curated, high-quality catalogs of regulatory regions resulting from a large-scale integrative analysis of DNA-binding experiments in Human, Mouse, Fly and Arabidopsis thaliana for hundreds of transcription factors and regulators. In this 2022 update, we have uniformly processed >11 000 DNA-binding sequencing datasets from public sources across four species. The four regulatory catalogs are browsable through track hubs at UCSC, Ensembl and NCBI genome browsers.",

The updated Human regulatory atlas includes 8103 datasets covering a total of 1210 transcriptional regulators (TRs) with a catalog of 182 million (M) peaks, while the updated Arabidopsis atlas reaches 4.8M peaks, 423 TRs across 694 datasets. Also, this ReMap release is enriched by two new regulatory catalogs for Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster. First, the Mouse regulatory catalog consists of 123M peaks across 648 TRs as a result of the integration and validation of 5503 ChIP-seq datasets. Second, the Drosophila melanogaster catalog contains 16.6M peaks across 550 TRs from the integration of 1205 datasets. The four regulatory catalogs are browsable through track hubs at UCSC, Ensembl and NCBI genome browsers. Finally, ReMap 2022 comes with a new Cis Regulatory Module identification method, improved quality controls, faster search results, and better user experience with an interactive tour and video tutorials on browsing and filtering ReMap catalogs.",

However, the extent of the regulatory occupancy space in the human genome has not yet been fully apprehended by integrating public ChIP-seq data sets and combining it with ENCODE TFs map. To enable genome-wide identification of regulatory elements we have collected, analysed and retained 395 available ChIP-seq data sets merged with ENCODE peaks covering a total of 237 TFs. This enhanced repertoire complements and refines current genome-wide occupancy maps by increasing the human genome regulatory search space by 14% compared to ENCODE alone, and also increases the complexity of the regulatory dictionary. As a direct application we used this unified binding repertoire to annotate variant enhancer loci (VELs) from H3K4me1 mark in two cancer cell lines (MCF-7, CRC) and observed enrichments of specific TFs involved in biological key functions to cancer development and proliferation. Those enrichments of TFs within VELs provide a direct annotation of non-coding regions detected in cancer genomes. Finally, full access to this catalogue is available online together with the TFs enrichment analysis tool (http://tagc.univ-mrs.fr/remap/).",

In 2015, we introduced the ReMap database to capture the genome regulatory space by integrating public ChIP-seq datasets, covering 237 TRs across 13 million (M) peaks. In this release, we have extended this catalog to constitute a unique collection of regulatory regions. Specifically, we have collected, analyzed and retained after quality control a total of 2829 ChIP-seq datasets available from public sources, covering a total of 485 TRs with a catalog of 80M peaks. Additionally, the updated database includes new search features for TR names as well as aliases, including cell line names and the ability to navigate the data directly within genome browsers via public track hubs. Finally, full access to this catalog is available online together with a TR binding enrichment analysis tool. ReMap 2018 provides a significant update of the ReMap database, providing an in depth view of the complexity of the regulatory landscape in human.",

Second, a catalog of 33 histone modifications and variants across 4.5M peaks from the integration of 286 ChIP-seq datasets.
