                "abstract": "Motivation: Alignment of protein structures is a major problem in structural biology. The first approach commonly used is to consider proteins as rigid bodies. However, alignment of protein structures can be very complex due to conformational variability, or complex evolutionary relationships between proteins such as insertions, circular permutations or repetitions. In such cases, introducing flexibility becomes useful for two reasons: (i) it can help compare two protein chains which adopted two different conformational states, such as due to proteins/ligands interaction or post-translational modifications, and (ii) it aids in the identification of conserved regions in proteins that may have distant evolutionary relationships. Results: We propose ICARUS, a new approach for flexible structural alignment based on identification of Protein Units, evolutionarily preserved structural descriptors of intermediate size, between secondary structures and domains. ICARUS significantly outperforms reference methods on a dataset of very difficult structural alignments.",
