                "abstract": "Summary: Drug discovery targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest known class of therapeutic targets, is challenging. To facilitate the rapid discovery and development of GPCR drugs, we built a system, PanGPCR, to predict multiple potential GPCR targets and their expression locations in the tissues, side effects and possible repurposing of GPCR drugs. With PanGPCR, the compound of interest is docked to a library of 36 experimentally determined crystal structures comprising of 46 docking sites for human GPCRs, and a ranked list is generated from the docking studies to assess all GPCRs and their binding affinities. Users can determine a given compound s GPCR targets and its repurposing potential accordingly. Moreover, potential side effects collected from the SIDER (Side- Effect Resource) database and mapped to 45 tissues and organs are provided by linking predicted off-targets and their expressed sequence tag profiles. With PanGPCR, multiple targets, repurposing potential and side effects can be determined by simply uploading a small ligand.",
