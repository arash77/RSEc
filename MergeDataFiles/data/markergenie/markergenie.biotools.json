                "abstract": "Motivation: Natural language processing (NLP) tasks aim to convert unstructured text data (e.g. articles or dialogues) to structured information. In recent years, we have witnessed fundamental advances of NLP technique, which has been widely used in many applications such as financial text mining, news recommendation and machine translation. However, its application in the biomedical space remains challenging due to a lack of labeled data, ambiguities and inconsistencies of biological terminology. In biomedical marker discovery studies, tools that rely on NLP models to automatically and accurately extract relations of biomedical entities are valuable as they can provide a more thorough survey of all available literature, hence providing a less biased result compared to manual curation. In addition, the fast speed of machine reader helps quickly orient research and development. Results: To address the aforementioned needs, we developed automatic training data labeling, rule-based biological terminology cleaning and a more accurate NLP model for binary associative and multi-relation prediction into the MarkerGenie program. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods in identifying relations between biomedical entities on various benchmark datasets and case studies.",
