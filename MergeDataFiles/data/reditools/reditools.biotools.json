                "abstract": "Background: RNA editing is a widespread co-/post-transcriptional mechanism that alters primary RNA sequences through the modification of specific nucleotides and it can increase both the transcriptome and proteome diversity. The automatic detection of RNA-editing from RNA-seq data is computational intensive and limited to small data sets, thus preventing a reliable genome-wide characterisation of such process. Results: In this work we introduce HPC-REDItools, an upgraded tool for accurate RNA-editing events discovery from large dataset repositories. Availability: https://github.com/BioinfoUNIBA/REDItools2. Conclusions: HPC-REDItools is dramatically faster than the previous version, REDItools, enabling big-data analysis by means of a MPI-based implementation and scaling almost linearly with the number of available cores.",

                "abstract": "RNA editing is a widespread post-transcriptional mechanism able to modify transcripts through insertions/deletions or base substitutions. It is prominent in mammals, in which millions of adenosines are deaminated to inosines by members of the ADAR family of enzymes. A-to-I RNA editing has a plethora of biological functions, but its detection in large-scale transcriptome datasets is still an unsolved computational task. To this aim, we developed REDItools, the first software package devoted to the RNA editing profiling in RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) data. It has been successfully used in human transcriptomes, proving the tissue and cell type specificity of RNA editing as well as its pervasive nature. Outcomes from large-scale REDItools analyses on human RNAseq data have been collected in our specialized REDIportal database, containing more than 4.5 million events. Here we describe in detail two bioinformatic procedures based on our computational resources, REDItools and REDIportal. In the first procedure, we outline a workflow to detect RNA editing in the human cell line NA12878, for which transcriptome and whole genome data are available. In the second procedure, we show how to identify dysregulated editing at specific recoding sites in post-mortem brain samples of Huntington disease donors. On a 64-bit computer running Linux with â‰¥32 GB of random-access memory (RAM), both procedures should take ~76 h, using 4 to 24 cores. Our protocols have been designed to investigate RNA editing in different organisms with available transcriptomic and/or genomic reads. Scripts to complete both procedures and a docker image are available at https://github.com/BioinfoUNIBA/REDItools.",

It occurs in a variety of organisms and different cellular locations through evolutionally and biochemically unrelated proteins. RNA editing has a plethora of biological effects including the modulation of alternative splicing and fine-tuning of gene expression. RNA editing events by base substitutions can be detected on a genomic scale by NGS technologies through the REDItools package, an ad hoc suite of Python scripts to study RNA editing using RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq data or RNA-Seq data alone. REDItools implement effective filters to minimize biases due to sequencing errors, mapping errors, and SNPs. The package is freely available at Google Code repository (http://code.google.com/p/reditools/) and released under the MIT license.
