about:
  description: Package blima includes several algorithms for the preprocessing of
    Illumina microarray data. It focuses to the bead level analysis and provides novel
    approach to the quantile normalization of the vectors of unequal lengths. It provides
    variety of the methods for background correction including background subtraction,
    RMA like convolution and background outlier removal. It also implements variance
    stabilizing transformation on the bead level. There are also implemented methods
    for data summarization. It also provides the methods for performing T-tests on
    the detector (bead) level and on the probe level for differential expression testing.
