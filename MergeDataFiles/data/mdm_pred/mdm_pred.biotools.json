                "abstract": "The human gut microbiota (HGM) comprises a complex population of microorganisms that significantly affect human health, including their influence on xenobiotics metabolism. Many pharmaceuticals are taken orally and thus come into contact with HGM, which can metabolize them. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of HGM on the fate of pharmaceuticals in the organism. We have collected information about over 600 compounds from more than eighty publications. At least half of them (329 compounds) are known to be metabolized by HGM. We have used PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) software to build three classification SAR models for HGM-mediated drug metabolism prediction. The first model with an accuracy of prediction 0.85 estimates whether compounds will be metabolized by HGM. The second model with an average accuracy of prediction 0.92 estimates which bacterial genera are responsible for the drug metabolism. The third model with an average accuracy of prediction 0.92 estimates the biotransformation reactions during HGM-mediated drug metabolism. The created models were used to develop the freely available web application MDM-Pred (http://www.way2drug.com/mdm-pred/).",
