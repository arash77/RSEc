description: ncRNAtools provides a set of basic tools for handling and analyzing non-coding
  RNAs. These include tools to access the RNAcentral database and to predict and visualize
  the secondary structure of non-coding RNAs. The package also provides tools to read,
  write and interconvert the file formats most commonly used for representing such
  secondary structures.
