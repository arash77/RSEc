                "abstract": "Waddington&#x0027;s epigenetic landscape is a framework depicting the processes of cell differentiation and reprogramming under the control of a gene regulatory network (GRN). Traditional model-driven methods for landscape quantification focus on the Boolean network or differential equation-based models of GRN, which need sophisticated prior knowledge and hence hamper their practical applications. To resolve this problem, we combine data-driven methods for inferring GRNs from gene expression data with model-driven approach to the landscape mapping. Specifically, we build an end-to-end pipeline to link data-driven and model-driven methods and develop a software tool named TMELand for GRN inference, visualizing Waddington&#x0027;s epigenetic landscape, and calculating state transition paths between attractors to uncover the intrinsic mechanism of cellular transition dynamics. By integrating GRN inference from real transcriptomic data with landscape modeling, TMELand can facilitate studies of computational systems biology, such as predicting cellular states and visualizing the dynamical trends of cell fate determination and transition dynamics from single-cell transcriptomic data. The source code of TMELand, a user manual, and model files of case studies can be downloaded freely from <uri>https://github.com/JieZheng-ShanghaiTech/TMELand</uri>.",
