about:
  description: cosmiq is a tool for the preprocessing of liquid- or gas - chromatography
    mass spectrometry (LCMS/GCMS) data with a focus on metabolomics or lipidomics
    applications. To improve the detection of low abundant signals, cosmiq generates
    master maps of the mZ/RT space from all acquired runs before a peak detection
    algorithm is applied. The result is a more robust identification and quantification
    of low-intensity MS signals compared to conventional approaches where peak picking
    is performed in each LCMS/GCMS file separately. The cosmiq package builds on the
    xcmsSet object structure and can be therefore integrated well with the package
    xcms as an alternative preprocessing step.
