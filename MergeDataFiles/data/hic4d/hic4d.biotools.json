                "abstract": "The Hi-C experiments have been extensively used for the studies of genomic structures. In the last few years, spatiotemporal Hi-C has largely contributed to the investigation of genome dynamic reorganization. However, computationally modeling and forecasting spatiotemporal Hi-C data still have not been seen in the literature. We present HiC4D for dealing with the problem of forecasting spatiotemporal Hi-C data. We designed and benchmarked a novel network and named it residual ConvLSTM (ResConvLSTM), which is a combination of residual network and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). We evaluated our new ResConvLSTM networks and compared them with the other five methods, including a na√Øve network (NaiveNet) that we designed as a baseline method and four outstanding video-prediction methods from the literature: ConvLSTM, spatiotemporal LSTM (ST-LSTM), self-attention LSTM (SA-LSTM) and simple video prediction (SimVP). We used eight different spatiotemporal Hi-C datasets for the blind test, including two from mouse embryogenesis, one from somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos, three embryogenesis datasets from different species and two non-embryogenesis datasets. Our evaluation results indicate that our ResConvLSTM networks almost always outperform the other methods on the eight blind-test datasets in terms of accurately predicting the Hi-C contact matrices at future time-steps. Our benchmarks also indicate that all of the methods that we benchmarked can successfully recover the boundaries of topologically associating domains called on the experimental Hi-C contact matrices. Taken together, our benchmarks suggest that HiC4D is an effective tool for predicting spatiotemporal Hi-C data. HiC4D is publicly available at both http://dna.cs.miami.edu/HiC4D/ and https://github.com/zwang-bioinformatics/HiC4D/.",
