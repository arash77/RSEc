                "abstract": "The rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with multi-sites mutations is considered as a major obstacle for the development of drugs and vaccines. Although most of the functional proteins essential for SARS-CoV-2 have been determined, the understanding of the COVID-19 target-ligand interactions remains a key challenge. The old version of this COVID-19 docking server was built in 2020, and free and open to all users. Here, we present nCoVDock2, a new docking server to predict the binding modes for targets from SARS-CoV-2. First, the new server supports more targets. We replaced the modeled structures with newly resolved structures and added more potential targets of COVID-19, especially for the variants. Second, for small molecule docking, Autodock Vina was upgraded to the latest version 1.2.0, and a new scoring function was added for peptide or antibody docking. Third, the input interface and molecular visualization were updated for a better user experience. The web server, together with an extensive help and tutorial, are freely available at: https://ncovdock2.schanglab.org.cn.",
