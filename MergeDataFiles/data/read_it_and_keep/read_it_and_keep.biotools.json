    "description": "Read-it-and-keep is a bioinformatics tool designed to filter and extract sequencing reads according to user-defined criteria, such as the presence of specific motifs or coverage of regions of interest. This type of filtering can be particularly useful for targeted analyses, where only relevant sequences are retained for further study, optimising computing and storage resources.",
