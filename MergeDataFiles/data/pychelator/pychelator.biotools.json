    "description": "PyChelator is a Python-based Colab and web application for metal chelator calculations, taking into account pH, temperature, and ionic strength. The build-in constants can be used for EGTA and ATP as chelators, together with Calcium and Magnesium as metals. Additionally, user-defined constants can be used to calculate other metals and chelators. PyChelator offers enhanced user experience and customization options, based on the well-established and widely used Maxchelator framework.  \nThe Python code in a Google Colaboratory notebook makes the PyChelator functionalities readily available to the Python-using scientific community for further development.",

                "abstract": "Background: Metal ions play vital roles in regulating various biological systems, making it essential to control the concentration of free metal ions in solutions during experimental procedures. Several software applications exist for estimating the concentration of free metals in the presence of chelators, with MaxChelator being the easily accessible choice in this domain. This work aimed at developing a Python version of the software with arbitrary precision calculations, extensive new features, and a user-friendly interface to calculate the free metal ions. Results: We introduce the open-source PyChelator web application and the Python-based Google Colaboratory notebook, PyChelator Colab. Key features aim to improve the user experience of metal chelator calculations including input in smaller units, selection among stability constants, input of user-defined constants, and convenient download of all results in Excel format. These features were implemented in Python language by employing Google Colab, facilitating the incorporation of the calculator into other Python-based pipelines and inviting the contributions from the community of Python-using scientists for further enhancements. Arbitrary-precision arithmetic was employed by using the built-in Decimal module to obtain the most accurate results and to avoid rounding errors. No notable differences were observed compared to the results obtained from the PyChelator web application. However, comparison of different sources of stability constants showed substantial differences among them. Conclusions: PyChelator is a user-friendly metal and chelator calculator that provides a platform for further development. It is provided as an interactive web application, freely available for use at https://amrutelab.github.io/PyChelator, and as a Python-based Google Colaboratory notebook at https://colab.research.google.com/github/AmruteLab/PyChelator/blob/main/PyChelator_Colab.ipynb.",
