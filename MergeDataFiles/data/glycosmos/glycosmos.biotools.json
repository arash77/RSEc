GlyCosmos is a portal for glycan-related repositories, including GlyTouCan, GlycoPOST, and UniCarb-DR, as well as for glycan-related data resources that have been integrated from a variety of ‘omics databases. Glycogenes, glycoproteins, lectins, pathways, and disease information related to glycans are accessible from GlyCosmos. PubChem, on the other hand, is a chemistry-based portal at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. PubChem provides information not only on chemicals, but also genes, proteins, pathways, as well as patents, bioassays, and more, from hundreds of data resources from around the world. In this work, these 2 portals have made substantial efforts to integrate their complementary data to allow users to cross between these 2 domains. In addition to glycan structures, key information, such as glycan-related genes, relevant diseases, glycoproteins, and pathways, was integrated and cross-linked with one another. The interfaces were designed to enable users to easily find, access, download, and reuse data of interest across these resources. Use cases are described illustrating and highlighting the type of content that can be investigated. In total, these integrations provide life science researchers improved awareness and enhanced access to glycan-related information.",
