                "abstract": "Recent advances in genome sequencing have led to an increase in the number of sequenced genomes. However, the presence of repetitive sequences complicates the assembly of plant genomes. The LTR assembly index (LAI) has recently been widely used to assess the quality of genome assembly, as a higher LAI is associated with a higher quality of assembly. Here, we assessed the quality of assembled genomes of 1664 plant and algal genomes using LAI and reported the results as data repository called PlantLAI (https://bioinformatics.um6p.ma/PlantLAI). A number of 55 117 586 pseudomolecules/scaffolds with a total length of 988.11 gigabase-pairs were examined using the LAI workflow. A total of 46 583 551 accurate LTR-RTs were discovered, including 2 263 188 Copia, 2 933 052 Gypsy, and 1 387 311 unknown superfamilies. Consequently, only 1136 plant genomes are suitable for LAI calculation, with values ranging from 0 to 31.59. Based on the quality classification system, 476 diploid genomes were classified as draft, 472 as reference, and 135 as gold genomes. We also provide a free webtool to calculate the LAI of newly assembled genomes and the ability to save the result in the repository. The data repository is designed to fill in the gaps in the reported LAI of existing genomes, while the webtool is designed to help researchers calculate the LAI of their newly sequenced genomes.",
