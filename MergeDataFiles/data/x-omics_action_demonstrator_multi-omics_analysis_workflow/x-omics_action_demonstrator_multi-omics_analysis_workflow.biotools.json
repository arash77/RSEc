    "description": "This multi-omics data analysis workflow was developed as part of a case study investigating shared patterns between multi-omics data and childhood externalizing behaviour. The modular Nextflow workflow was implemented using FAIR practices. It comprises genome-wide DNA methylation, targeted metabolomics and behaviour data pre-processing, and integrative analysis methods. Individuals of a cohort are clustered using Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), latent feature dimensions are uncovered using different unsupervised methods including Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and correlations between -omics and phenotype dimensions are determined in downstream analyses including results visualisation.",

                "abstract": "Background: Applying good data management and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles in research projects can help disentangle knowledge discovery, study result reproducibility, and data reuse in future studies. Based on the concepts of the original FAIR principles for research data, FAIR principles for research software were recently proposed. FAIR Digital Objects enable discovery and reuse of Research Objects, including computational workflows for both humans and machines. Practical examples can help promote the adoption of FAIR practices for computational workflows in the research community. We developed a multi-omics data analysis workflow implementing FAIR practices to share it as a FAIR Digital Object. Findings: We conducted a case study investigating shared patterns between multi-omics data and childhood externalizing behavior. The analysis workflow was implemented as a modular pipeline in the workflow manager Nextflow, including containers with software dependencies. We adhered to software development practices like version control, documentation, and licensing. Finally, the workflow was described with rich semantic metadata, packaged as a Research Object Crate, and shared via WorkflowHub. Conclusions: Along with the packaged multi-omics data analysis workflow, we share our experiences adopting various FAIR practices and creating a FAIR Digital Object. We hope our experiences can help other researchers who develop omics data analysis workflows to turn FAIR principles into practice.",
