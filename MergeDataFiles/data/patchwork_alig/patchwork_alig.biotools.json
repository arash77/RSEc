                "abstract": "Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (also known as “genome skimming”) is becoming an increasingly affordable approach to large-scale phylogenetic analyses. While already routinely used to recover organellar genomes, genome skimming is rather rarely utilized for recovering single-copy nuclear markers. One reason might be that only few tools exist to work with this data type within a phylogenomic context, especially to deal with fragmented genome assemblies. We here present a new software tool called Patchwork for mining phylogenetic markers from highly fragmented short-read assemblies as well as directly from sequence reads. Patchwork is an alignment-based tool that utilizes the sequence aligner DIAMOND and is written in the programming language Julia. Homologous regions are obtained via a sequence similarity search, followed by a “hit stitching” phase, in which adjacent or overlapping regions are merged into a single unit. The novel sliding window algorithm trims away any noncoding regions from the resulting sequence. We demonstrate the utility of Patchwork by recovering near-universal single-copy orthologs within a benchmarking study, and we additionally assess the performance of Patchwork in comparison with other programs. We find that Patchwork allows for accurate retrieval of (putatively) single-copy genes from genome skimming data sets at different sequencing depths with high computational speed, outperforming existing software targeting similar tasks.
