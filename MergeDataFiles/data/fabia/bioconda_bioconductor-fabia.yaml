  description: Biclustering by "Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition" (FABIA).
    FABIA is a model-based technique for biclustering, that is clustering rows and
    columns simultaneously. Biclusters are found by factor analysis where both the
    factors and the loading matrix are sparse. FABIA is a multiplicative model that
    extracts linear dependencies between samples and feature patterns. It captures
    realistic non-Gaussian data distributions with heavy tails as observed in gene
    expression measurements. FABIA utilizes well understood model selection techniques
    like the EM algorithm and variational approaches and is embedded into a Bayesian
    framework. FABIA ranks biclusters according to their information content and separates
    spurious biclusters from true biclusters. The code is written in C.
