  description: 'RNAclust is a perl script summarizing all the single steps required
    for

    clustering of structured RNA motifs, i.e. identifying groups of RNA

    sequences sharing a secondary structure motif. It requires as input a

    multiple FASTA file. In the first step for each input sequence the base

    pair probability matrix of its secondary structure distribution is

    calculated (using RNAfold from the Vienna RNA package). Secondly, for

    each pair of base pair probability matrices a sequence-structure alignment

    is calculated using LocARNA. Lastly, a hierarchical cluster-tree (in

    NEWICK format) is derived by WPGMA clustering of the pairwise alignment

    distances and the optimal number of clusters is calculated from the tree.
