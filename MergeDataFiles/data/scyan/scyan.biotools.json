Based on biological knowledge prior, it provides a fast cell population annotation without requiring any training label. Scyan is an interpretable model that also corrects batch-effect and can be used for debarcoding, cell sampling, and population discovery.",

                "abstract": "Cytometry enables precise single-cell phenotyping within heterogeneous populations. These cell types are traditionally annotated via manual gating, but this method lacks reproducibility and sensitivity to batch effect. Also, the most recent cytometers - spectral flow or mass cytometers - create rich and high-dimensional data whose analysis via manual gating becomes challenging and time-consuming. To tackle these limitations, we introduce Scyan https://github.com/MICS-Lab/scyan, a Single-cell Cytometry Annotation Network that automatically annotates cell types using only prior expert knowledge about the cytometry panel. For this, it uses a normalizing flow - a type of deep generative model - that maps protein expressions into a biologically relevant latent space. We demonstrate that Scyan significantly outperforms the related state-of-the-art models on multiple public datasets while being faster and interpretable. In addition, Scyan overcomes several complementary tasks, such as batch-effect correction, debarcoding and population discovery. Overall, this model accelerates and eases cell population characterization, quantification and discovery in cytometry.",
