# Documentation: RSE Metadata Explorer


## Aim:
This web application aims to allow researchers and scientists to explore the metadata of various bioinformatics tools and containers. To make the process of finding and utilizing these biotools and biocontainers more efficient, this application fetches the metadata of biotools and biocontainers from the git repository of Research Software Ecosystem Content (https://github.com/research-software-ecosystem/content.git), and provides a user-friendly interface to show, search, and filter these biotools and biocontainers.

## Usage:
To use the application, use the static site deployed at (https://hash-bash.github.io/StudyProject/) using GitHub Pages. The web application has the following features:

### Searching:
The search functionality allows users to perform query-based searches to find specific bio tools and containers. Searching is relevance-based, which lists relevant tools according to the search string being part of Tool Name > Tool Tags > Tool Description.

> **Notes:** Searching is case-insensitive, so "BWA" and "bwa" will return the same results. Tags in the context of searching are the `EDAM Topics` available on the tool details page if they exist.

**Query Search:** Searching in the web application also employs querying. Query searching allows users to search a combination of different comma-separated queries, where a query can be can either a search string or a tag. Following are some of the examples of the input string describing the use-case:
1. Single search string (Tool Name, Tool Description, or a Tag):
   - BWA
   - DeepTools
   - tag:mapping
   - tag:antimicrobial resistance
2. Combination of search strings: (input comma separated queries like below)
   - bwa, kit
   - BWA, tag:mapping
   - tag:sequence assembly, tag:mapping
   - SALSA, tag:sequence assembly, tag:mapping
3. Input `tag:*` to list all the tags available.

Searching can be done by the search bar available on the home page of the application.

### Filtering:
The application provides various filtering options to narrow down search results based on specific criteria. This helps users quickly find the most relevant tools for their needs. The following are the filters available in the web application:
1. Data Availability: Filter to check if tools have Bioconda Packages or Biocontainers or if they are compatible with Galaxy.
2. License: Filter the tools according to the licenses fetched from the metadata.
3. Favourite: Filter the tools that are marked as Favourite by the user.

These filters are available on the home page of the application.

### Sorting:
The tools on the homepage can be sorted by Name, Creation Date, and Last Modified Date. A drop-down on the home page of the application provides this functionality. By default, the tools are sorted by their Names.

### Favourites:
Users can mark bio tools and containers as favorites for quick access in the future. The favorites functionality ensures that users can maintain a personalized list of frequently used tools, stored in the browser. To mark a tool as a favourite, Users must go to the tool's details page by clicking on the tool name and then toggling the star in the top-right corner.

### URLs Sharing:
If users want to share the URL with a search query, it can be done by sharing the URL and appending `/?search=SEARCH QUERY`, which will be automatically converted to `/?search=SEARCH+QUERY`. Following are some of the examples of the URLs with the search query:
   - https://hash-bash.github.io/StudyProject/?search=1000Genomes+ID+history+converter `(Gives the tools with search string as 1000Genomes ID history converter)`
   - https://hash-bash.github.io/StudyProject/?search=tag:antimicrobial+resistance,+fargene `(Gives the tools with result consisting Tag antimicrobial resistance and search string as fargene)`

If users want to share a link to a tool, they can directly share the URL available on the tool's details page. The following are some of the examples:
   - https://hash-bash.github.io/StudyProject/tool/1000genomes_id_history_converter
   - https://hash-bash.github.io/StudyProject/tool/fargene


## Setup and Installation:

### With Makefile

Since this application utilizes Makefile, the procedure of setting up and running this project locally can be done simply by:

#### 1. Installing `make`
   **Windows (Open PowerShell as Administrator and run):**
   ```bash
   choco install make
   ```
   **Ubuntu (Install using apt in Terminal):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install make
   ```
#### 2. Clone the Repository:
   > **Note:** Make sure that Git is installed beforehand
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hash-bash/StudyProject.git
   ```
#### 3. Change the current directory to the root of the project `StudyProject`:
   ```bash
   cd StudyProject
   ```
#### 4. Run the following `make` command:
   ```bash
   make run-full-workflow
   ```

You should now be able to access the site locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

This `make` command will install all the necessary dependencies, collect/update all the metadata from the RSC repository, share it with the frontend app, and generate/update a static site to browse through this metadata. Please check other `make` commands in the Makefile for ease of development and usage of the application.

### Without Makefile

To set up and run the project locally **without** using `make`, we can follow the below procedure:

### 1. Install the prerequisites:
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher): Required for running the Nuxt.js frontend.
- **Python** (v3.x): Required for running the Python scripts to process and merge metadata files.
- **Git**: For version control and managing repository changes.
- **GitHub CLI** (optional): For easier management of GitHub Actions and repository interactions.

### 2. Clone the Repository:
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hash-bash/StudyProject.git
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies:
Navigate to the `StudyProject/MergeDataFiles` folder and install the required Python dependencies:
1. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   cd StudyProject/MergeDataFiles
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install the necessary Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will install all required packages, including `PyYAML` for parsing YAML files.

### 4. Install Node.js Dependencies:
Navigate to the `StudyProject/StaticSiteGeneration` directory and install the required Node.js dependencies using `npm`:
   ```bash
   cd StudyProject/StaticSiteGeneration
   npm install
   ```

### 5. Clone the RSE Content Repository:
We have to clone the RSE Content Repository to the directory `StudyProject/MergeDataFiles`, which will be later used by the python script to fetch and combine the metadata file:
```bash
cd StudyProject/MergeDataFiles
git clone https://github.com/hash-bash/StudyProject.git
```
This will create a folder called as `content` in the directory.

### 6. Run the Python Script
The Python script `merge_data_files.py` in `StudyProject/MergeDataFiles` processes and merges the metadata into `combined_metadata.json`. This file is later used by the Nuxt.js frontend.
```bash
python merge_data_files.py
```
This will generate the `combined_metadata.json` file in the `StudyProject/MergeDataFiles` folder.

### 7. Copy the Generated JSON to the Static Site Folder
After running the Python script, copy the `combined_metadata.json` file from the `StudyProject/MergeDataFiles` folder to the `StudyProject/StaticSiteGeneration/public` folder:
```bash
cp StudyProject/MergeDataFiles/combined_metadata.json StudyProject/StaticSiteGeneration/public/
```

### 8. Generate the Static Site
Navigate to the `StudyProject/StaticSiteGeneration` directory and run the following command to generate the static site:
```bash
cd StudyProject/StaticSiteGeneration
npm run generate
```
This will create a fully static site in the `.output/public` directory.

### 9. Preview the Site
To preview the generated static site, run:
```bash
npm run preview
```
You should now be able to access the site locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
